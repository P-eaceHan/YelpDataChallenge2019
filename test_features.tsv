485juGN7xennwKdLzToQrw	5	The gang at Sun Valley Stereo is definitely top notch. Ryan gets right to the point and saw what I was interested in  and we worked together to verify that all the parts were in to upgrade my 2004 RX-8 with a Pioneer 4000NEX touchscreen and back-up camera before I drove 90 minutes for the work. When I first left there was some adjustments needed. They took me back in without hesitation and made everything right. The installer was committed to treating my car like it was his own. He took the extra steps to make it all right  and even fixed the hatch door to my 12-volt socket. Now that's going the extra mile! 6-stars!
fw250dMxO-eqOgryNqBRAQ	1	why do these guys suck? how hard is it to ring a bell to see if the receiver is home?  I've had multiple issues with them  and wish Amazon would stop using them.
SVOxLL37tIeTzPEukht18g	5	I had two different experiences with Carpet Monkey. In both instances the person who came to clean was on time and it was easy to get a hold of the company when I needed to. Also  they call around 15-30 minutes beforehand to let you know they are on the way. This is a great help since I had to drive 45 minutes to meet them so it was nice knowing how far they were. Their price was also quite good since I requested 4 rooms upstairs  hallway  stairs  and downstairs bedroom. Now the first experience I had was on 09/15. The person who came to clean was Mark. I was not satisfied at all with his work. He didn't clean a good 2 inches from the walls around the whole perimeter of the house. The stairs looked worse than before he came. There were soo many stains that he said should come out that were still there and the carpet was extra crunchy after it dried. Any time we tried to mention something to him we would always get the same response that he's been doing this for 28 or 30 years and wouldn't really listen to our concern. In a normal situation that would warrant an instant 1 star review since I chose this company based on over 500 positive reviews and the pictures seemed great. The work I had gotten done on 09/15 was not anywhere near what the pictures looked like. However instead of rushing to yelp I figured this company doesn't have 500 plus good reviews for nothing and called them up around 09/20. This is where I can really appreciate this company's commitment to customers. When I called I believe the owner picked up. If I remember correctly his name was Rick. I told him everything that happened and he was very cooperative about the fact that I wasn't satisfied at all with Mark's work. He said he'll send his right hand man Joe out and we were quickly able to schedule for 09/22. Again communication is very easy with this company. On top of that Rick told me the second visit wouldn't be of charge. So Saturday comes and we get a phone call from Isaac saying he's on his way  again great communication. I didn't worry too much that it wasn't Joe at our door like I was told since Isaac seemed like he knew what to do in these situations where the previous work wasn't satisfactory. He let me show him where I wasn't satisfied and could see where and why some of the stains didn't come out and said he'll go over all the areas. I was surprised since I thought he'd just go over the areas with spots only. But he went over everything all over again and everything looked A LOT better. The stairs actually looked like they had been cleaned this time and Isaac also went ahead and did the risers which I wasn't expecting. There were some stains that wouldn't come out but he had mentioned that to us. Overall his work actually resembled some of the yelp pictures and the carpets weren't nearly as crunchy when dried after Isaac went over them. He also put the corner protectors on the wall which I appreciated (something Mark didn't do). So my first experience was not good at all but the company was quick to help resolve the issue and reiterated how they wanted the customer to be happy and would do whatever they could to ensure that. This alone earns praise from me since it shows they care enough to at least try and make things better. Second experience with Isaac was WAY better and communication with the company is a breeze. Thank you Isaac and Rick!
GlcfY0-0FJfT80x6UBFBqA	1	If you can avoid this company  I recommend you do so. They are in the midst of overcharging me $100 for nothing  and insist I have to prove I don't owe it by going to their inconveniently located offices. They won't take a letter or FAX. Rude on the phone to me.  You have to watch them every month  as we have had other bills that were inaccurate (overbilling us) before  too. NO  I do not recommend.
s5CVHO59na2fianXJg0yYg	5	I was skeptical about all these great reviews. After taking my car into the shop  I won't take my car anywhere else in the Phoenix area.   Crawford's Auto repair was extremely thorough. They pinpointed a noise to three contributing factors: a rock in the tire  a roof rack bolt  and something in the sun roof. I love how detail-oriented these guys are.   They gave me a list of recommended repairs. Not once  did they push ...   Overall  the experience was great. I found it easy to schedule an appointment. I respected the fact that they honored their estimated time frames. I love how communicative they were.   Highly recommended!
35TAAd42m4SdOcX9xkgE6A	5	My sister-in-law and I saw Jeff at the start of the year... we saw his ad and we decided it was something we would want to check out... and we are so glad we did!    Jeff is hilarious and has great stage presence and really connects with his audience.  I even got pulled up on stage and got a crotch full of Jeff!  hahaha...   It's a very high energy show that he never lets up... he just goes and performs his little heart out much to the enjoyment of the audience.    If you're looking for a family friendly show that is different from the usual entertainment on the Strip then you cannot go wrong with Jeff Civillico!
Mto7puzyNVgNKQFrv8UVIQ	5	The gelato here is sent from the gods themselves.   Just kidding. Desyree makes everything that goes into the gelato herself. Same difference right?
dHS3PEH0rfs_ZBpQUok9KA	5	It's been about two weeks since Omar did my window tint. It looks great  he had to scrap off old nasty window tint that started to bubble. The work they do is awesome  this is the 3rd vehicle he has done for me. I've been very happy every time. I'll for sure always keep my business with him. Prices are fair  but the quality and professional service speaks for itself.  Thanks Omar
fH3bnm_HA3Kr8JgUZOuSww	5	Services are reasonable priced and they are HONEST. They did not try to sell us unnecessary parts or services and they back up their work as well.   Before Colburn  we had another plumber company (they advertise on the fwy billboards ( Yes  they can rip you off ) come in to give an estimate.. What they quoted was 200% more expensive then what Colburn worked on for us. I called the office and asked why they are so expensive. The person on the phone told us that   We are the best .... Well  I have to respond   Best at ripping us off!  and hung up the phone up.  Let's just say we will definitely use Colburn Enterprises again and again.
xQjJyFH0CobaHThR5iRm7A	5	Love this hidden gem!  The food is excellent  well-presented and affordable. I have tried the Kiss Taco  Kiss Papa Taco and Kiss Salad...all delicious!!
lZwyhdsaJoo-s5r_4OheMA	5	Professional  honest  fair pricing  and dependable.  I don't know about the rest of the yelp viewers out there but these are the most important traits I look for when doing business.  Carpet Monkey of Las Vegas delivered all of them in spades ( pardon the play on Las Vegas and spades   ). They were prompt and extremely professional  the owner was incredibly concerned with whether or whether not I was happy with his service. Just for the record I was extremely pleased. I am almost embarrassed to say what a difference they made on my tiles.  Night and day.  I've been in my house for 10 years regularly have it cleaned however I've never had my tiles steamed and chemically cleaned like they performed and what a difference  I'm so happy.   I just happen to find them via reading some reviews on yelp and thought that I'd give them a shot I am so glad I found them.  So if you're riding the fence on whether or whether not to give him a shot all I can say is I would pull the trigger and call them again in a heartbeat.  They will be my only go to carpet and tile guys from now on.
OLozj2FPPu5kgc4-G9VCTQ	5	My iPad Air screen was completely smashed  so I researched screen repairs.  Needless to say  it was very expensive to repair.  I stumbled upon this shop on the internet  I read up on them and they appeared to be a legitimate business.  Eventhough I was nervous to ship out my iPad  I shipped it to them (insurance and signature confirmation). They received it on a Friday  and I got it back the next Friday.   I received my iPad Air back in pristine and like-new condition.  It had been packed nicely and securely upon arrival. Thank you  I am so happy to have my iPad again with a new screen.
MQVA45iC4YZdPkNycF8H6w	1	Time and time again  tracking shows as DELIVERED  package nowhere to be found.  Paid extra for Saturday delivery - can't be located until Monday at the earliest  if ever.  Avoid like a plague!
vD5SAYaHyUTzIkynIrxdlg	5	A most excellent company to deal with.  They respond to e-mails and phone calls right away.  The workers are very professional  both Isaac (the person who did the initial inspection) and Josh (the person that did the treatment) were very polite and courteous.  I would definitely recommend this company.
O_zKYZq2dkelAeXzz3IKPA	5	I was selling some jewelry I called this place of business and the owner was extremely polite and very helpful and generous with his knowledge I then arrived ...he appraise my jewelry and gave me some tips as to how to sell it if I didn't want to sell it to him.... this was a pleasant experience for someone in the vulnerable position of selling jewels.. I would definitely shop here again and refer any friends and family to this business...
dAlrjmQi1Fmm-gbN1ijvug	5	Very professional! They were on time  friendly and explained the process before they began. I would recommend them to my mom. That is how good I think they were.
jPJosOuRgdd1ZNcwbBZHig	5	Anjoly Molina was Great! When we first walked in she greeted us with a friendly and warm smile... I felt really relief and didn't feel the pressure and bad vibes that a sales person always  gives out... She was easy to talk to and she was very knowledgable about her product!! Gave us the time and respect. And was very patient with us... I was clueless of what I wanted but at the end we bought our new mattress with her... It arrived the next day and we love it! Very happy with our purchase.... It's great to know we have 100+ days to exchange  just in case we not happy but I don't see that happening. The guys from delivery where nice and very fast... Over all it was a great experience thank you Anjoly for all your help... :)) I would recommend her anytime!!!
Qn2jtGrz8B2B85ffT7SXuQ	5	Excellent customer service!!!  From time to time  I'll decide to sell old jewelry that's been laying around for ages. I popped in here and I was SURPRISED at what a great experience it was. He took his time with me  very professional  very patient and very private! Another lady came in and he had her sit on the comfy couch and wait ... About 10/12 feet away. I like that a lot. Thanks Aaron!!!   * I've gone to places and felt like I might get approached by weirdos  robbed or killed in the parking lot on the way in or out! I did not feel that way here. That a major plus for me!!!
qpIiFQUxDaG6onBrSfXUBQ	5	Yeah this is a legit gelato spot.  5 stars and I never do that.  They have so many crazy food flavors that I've never seen before like sweet corn and gorgonzola cheese.  Who would have thought that that would even be worth eating but it is awesome.  The lady who was working the counter who I think is also the owner gave us a ton of samples and we weren't even asking for them.  I went with the passion fruit because I was looking for something sweet and tropical that evening.  It was great .  Fantastic place and I would love to head back here for sure!
TRQMZ3KX8fzfV92W2BeqFA	5	Amazing work! My carpets look like new! I have two dogs  one being a puppy... So you can imagine my poor carpets!  By the time Mark was done  the carpets were patched and looked and smelled amazing!  Having my furniture upholstery done next!  Thank you  Carpet Monkeys!  I highly recommend them!
taAkTkOv2wsKag5CEksvXA	1	So funny story  even though they've delivered to my house before  my Amazon order was undeliverable yesterday because it's the wrong address. Amazon emailed me asking me to update my shipping address.....hahahaha  it's not wrong. They can look up my order history to see just how many packages have been successfully delivered to what OnTrac believes to be an  undeliverable - wrong address.  Apparently this shipping company is a joke.
31GXi5RZnVkfQeeQhONupA	3	I found Affordable Flooring through Yelp.  I had high expectations and I can honestly say I was a little let down.  First  I felt like no one really managed my project properly once I gave the green light to move forward.  I gave clear instructions to both Gomez and Travis that were not communicated properly to their install team.  This could have been prevented if either Travis or Gomez showed up to the install site.  The install team did a fair job installing the tile  however work had to be re-done due to the miscommunication.  Attention to detail was subpar and needed to be addressed.  I paid extra to have the grout sealed and they did a very poor job.  They only put on one coat and it was of very poor quality.  I had to go back through afterwords and properly seal the grout myself.  I am not sure if I would use Affordable Flooring for my next project....
__e3lWDlRkL7i2SCyg2tvQ	5	Jeff's creativity  passion  and fun brings a smile on your face instantly. I brought two 13 year old aspiring performing artists and they were inspired by Jeff's stories  talent  and humor. This show is great for all ages  everyone leaves with something. I would bring more people to see this.
HE_ptzYIjdGhTd425BAEtQ	5	Super fast service . In and out ! Quality parts . I replaced my home button because i shattered it like a dumb ass. I would definitely recommend .
vt2e7RmlSxkgfsRreLmFYg	5	We turn in my wife's car for a fender and bumper repair. I had checked with 2 other body shops. Price was just a little higher. But I picked this from reviews. Sometimes the price is not the determining factor for me. Turn it in on Monday with a week as eta for the car being done. On Wednesday mid-morning received a call Car will be ready at 4 pm. One thing was overlooked. But it was not the reason the car turned in for. A little chip on the door handle was missed. But it was an afterthought. Can you do this? So no big deal. Still a 5 star review.
FHkko88bs2S7Ec_xxdjdoA	5	These guys just left my house.  They.  Are.  Awesome.  By way of full disclosure  I'm a male single parent of two (and a dog) that wishes he could afford a cleaning lady.  As such  the carpets in my house were pretty  um... nasty.  Like 'my girlfriend doesn't want her feet to touch the floor' nasty.  Anyway  these guys came in right on time for the appointment and made the place look brand spanking new.  I would give them five stars even if they were some mega-corporation-chain... but they're not.  They're a small family owned and operated business... which feels even better.  Thanks  yelpers  for turning me on to these guys.  I wouldn't dream of using another company.
vo5ef4uK59H03dNcXgeW7A	5	Stopped by during a visit from California and was impressed. Very cool and eclectic collection of vintage bicycles. Owner Craig was extremely knowledgable and friendly. Truly one of a kind!
mzpwzxbcWQBYWJDyA3KkqQ	5	These guys are absolutely on it! Gave them a call and not only did they able to accommodate a short notice request  they knocked it out with in record time! The one (of many) thing I like about these guys is  they educate you on what they are doing and why. Most companies come in to do a job and get out. Carpet Monkeys looks to educate and create a repeat customer.   They are definitely my go to crew for carpet cleaning!
cLulBQ7Fnh_ebvu1rM7j1g	5	the BEST BEST hotdogs!! If you havent tried chili mans hotdogs or even met the chili man  well im sorry you are missing out. 5stars no doubt!
4HBP9-jMyTv9qq2cN2NRMg	5	We just had the guys out to clean the carpets....excellent job and no chemical after smell.  I support small family business and I will use them again.
pOHzJlHNm3Jo-irDEnvxdw	5	I'm so glad I found this company! Mark was my technician. Honest. Down to Earth. Did an amazing job with my carpet repairs and cleaning. I have cats  and foster even more  so you can imagine what my carpets smelt like before they arrived. Mark suggested a 48 Hour Enzyme treatment when he first came over  and Rick the owner was able to fit me into the schedule for the second visit even though they were already plenty busy. During the second visit they reapplied the Enzyme Treatment before the final steam clean. They go beyond the basic needs. They actually CARE about their customers. They are also cheaper than most popular competitors! I already scheduled them to come out to do my tile  and will be calling them again in 6 months for another cleaning!
E9nrMfLMbuKTrnXxXMHu_w	5	Moved quite a bit farther away from my regular shop so I decided to search Yelp for a possible replacement. It was a tough decision as I feel a good auto shop ranks right up there with a good dentist/doctor/lawyer in importance.  After two visits I can happily say that I now have a new regular shop.  Terry is a straight shooter who really knows his stuff. I also like the fact that he is detail-oriented  and takes pride in his work.   You couple all that with very reasonable prices  a friendly atmosphere  and a great location made my decision a no brainer.
X_BqafQDZa1uO4SZXk4p9w	5	I called Colburn Enterprises after reading all their great reviews and I'm glad I did.   I needed to replace my Culligan water softener and they quoted me a reasonable price on one of their systems.   It was the lowest price from the other companies I called.  They were able to get me in the next day  from 9-11.  Jeremy  the technician  arrived right at 9.  He was very professional  efficient and knowledgeable.  He answered all my questions and made sure I didn't have any other questions before he left.  I liked that he cleaned up after himself and left my garage cleaner than before he came.  Definitely will call them in the future!
tcxNRU9lkc00g0ctqe7p_A	5	If I had to describe this show in one word it would be ENERGY.   Fortunately  I have enough space to leave a full review here!   Jeff Civillico has the most energy of any entertainer I have known. He spends the full hour + show running  juggling  and even unicycling  around the stage while being hysterically funny. He is not afraid to take chances and adds new  innovative  tricks and ideas to his show (such as the go-pro camera  his giant blow-up set  a tv show he filmed searching for unique and talented entertainers  partnerships and promotions of fellow entertainers...).  It truly is a must see show... you never knew juggling could be this entertaining  until you've seen Jeff's show. I have seen his show at least 3 times and am always taking family and friends when they come to town.   Aside from the show - Jeff has a great talent and an even bigger heart  giving back countless hours of entertainment and donations/fundraisers to several local charities on-stage and off. He also started Win-Win Entertainment to partner local charities with celebrities to help with their fundraising efforts. He is highly spoken about around town and I highly encourage you to support this great entertainer by seeing his show. I promise you won't be sorry.
x1cM8auYRzWc6nY8XW5g2Q	4	This place is awesome!   I came here because of Yelp and I'm so happy I decided to stop by. The gelato is really fresh and everything is made from scratch. They are very generous with the samples and I tried quite a few before I settled on strawberries and cream. It was amazing! I wanted something plain like vanilla but I was very happy with what I got. The cinnamon bun flavor tasted exactly like it was supposed to and I will try that next if they don't have vanilla.   This place is a little expensive so be prepared. It's also very cold inside the shop  which is odd to me because as hot as Vegas is it was too cold to enjoy my gelato in the shop!   Everyone who helped me was very nice and accommodating  which is a rare treat in Vegas. I was very pleased with the service and will definitely be returning!
IrcTBL1LRgv4Zz6p-tjFfg	1	I can't add anything to all of the other negative comments.  My experience was the same.  Waited all day then was on hold for 20 minutes until I finally gave up.  Sent an email to them and the response was laughable--just a lot of BS that any intelligent person would see right through.
6aZ_X2WPKe8oODs1ZTS1zA	5	I found JPG via Yelp and after checking out the website I knew I needed to give them a call.  Jim came out and spent the time to walk through the different systems and set me up for installation the very same day.  He gives you everything you need for free and monthly price is very competitive.  I would definitely recommend him and his company over any others - and I was a long-term ADT customer.
Ofy_5eyNBTpBUscldUIOlg	5	We had American Plumbing replace our front spigot and replace the valve that feeds our pool leveler in back. They also pulled out an old Reverse Osmosis System under a kitchen sink and fixed a bathroom sink faucet. I highly recommend American Plumbing based on our experience today. They called before they came  they showed up on time  and we're very professional and personable. Also  importantly  they charged us what they quoted us over the phone  even though they had to do a little bit extra work to make it all right. We are located in Gilbert and I would definitely use these guys again. Thank you American Plumbing.
M-cjT63pIuLgCB830h-GFw	5	What can I say  these guys did an incredible job! I've been let down by a lot of carpet cleaning companies in the past. Fortunately  that's not the case with Noble.  They showed up on time  were very respectful when doing the walk through and made my carpets and tile look brand new! They're also veteran owed and operated which you can definitely their work. Give these guys a shot  you won't be disappointed!
pnEcrrvKP47vmRFWwl8_2Q	5	I went out on a limb and it worked out Great!  I read the reviews  the location was ideal and when I walked in I was greeted with a smile  friendliness and willingness to answer my questions and the same thing happened when I picked up my iPad.   The screen had been smashed from blunt force  not just a drop.  I originally thought  this was it..new iPad needed based on how damaged it was.   Nope!  Great Price  Great Service  and finished in a couple of hours and I was able to take advantage of the YELP deal!   I won all they way around.   Nothing fancy here  just four walls and good people.  I used to go up the road but found it to be about 20-25% more expensive than Phoenix IPhone Repairs.  Now I found the right place to take my iPhone and iPad.
6yBfJesRzuzISfY-aCwrRQ	1	We are closing our office been on hold over 50 minutes to cancel our service. It's 2pm on a Wednesday WTH? This is a joke!
cDP4sB3nZ8Tejr5xvI8ohQ	5	Love  love  love this place!! My brows are perfect   Shania knows what she's doing and they come out perfectly every time! No more caterpillar brows! For any wax service you need to go to her  you'll be so very happy you did! Xoxo Thank you!
vEY-HVxObzGLN9GvBdRXLg	5	Had my eyebrows done here today and I am absolutely in love with this place. I lwave the country today and they were able to get me in last minute. It's so cute on the inside and everybody was soooo nice. Victoria did my brows and was such a sweetheart and did an amazing job. I had really bad experiences in the past with getting my eyebrows done at other places so I am so happy I came to this gem  I will definitely be back!
WaiHfG_S-C_EsAs7U7rV6w	5	Hands down some of the BEST service I have ever received! I am traveling from Colorado to California and made a stop in Vegas for the night. I called and asked if they could squeeze me in for an engine detail  and without hesitation and not even 2 hours later they met me and provided the best cleaning service I have seen! Thank you so much for your professionalism and willingness to help me out!!
HTNqRtkyWHIpiIbOMmL2rQ	1	Terrible service from delivery drivers.  I stayed home to wait for my package  and got a text that it had been delivered.  The driver never rang the doorbell.  Like most houses in San Francisco  there is no front yard  side yard  etc  just the gate or front  door right on the sidewalk.  There my package was  sitting out in front of my house  on the sidewalk  completely unsecured.  There was no attempt do anything but dump it there with no regard for it being stolen. I hate it when my Amazon packages ship from the huge Phoenix warehouse  b/c OnTrac is the worst delivery service in the US.
JowD-Xpjy72PaE4rvdn66Q	5	Outstanding service.  He did the  BEST job of anyone who has ever cleaned our dryer vents. I highly recommend Matt.
NEIf1DC80udGbjq0v3tngQ	4	Randy from Randyland fame recommended this jewel. I think they send folks over to each other's places!  This is 3 floors filled w/ all things bike!  PeeWee Herman's bike was there as were ones from my childhood. Even found one very similar to one I had as a pre-teen (my 17 & 23 yo sons were not impressed w/ my bike lol). The steps up to the upper floors are steep so not for those who have trouble w/ climbing stairs.  Admission is free but accept donations. It is beside another cool looking place (nostalgia) but they were closed.  This is a little out of the way but worth the trip coming from Randyland!
Hue2--XxoeqQwjCVJNi17w	5	Service was awesome  crew showed up on time and were very polite. I had pet stains and carpets weren't fresh smelling.  The end result was super clean carpets and a delightful smell. Would definitely recommend!
sw9553e86Vlyx_jm4wXSOA	3	Just OK We had plain chocolate  pistachio  coconut  mango.  Nothing That would make me visit the store again.
R-dmhUc3-JghiTe5IKvwQg	5	This show is a gem hidden in plain sight on the Vegas Strip.  My friends and I came to Las Vegas for a rousing bachelor party weekend  heard about this show  and found ourselves falling out of our chairs in laughter while also being amazed at the talent.  This is by far the best way to spend an afternoon in Las Vegas.
w34wN6rIzhw0A_hTUZ8ejA	5	Best detail did really good job. We will be using them for our entire office. Thank You Peter
t6dYKuROERolWVCMBVyp-Q	5	Found these guys on Yelp. They were courteous  knowledgeable  fast and thorough. I would use them again.
FU9wDb2qMCDp2mG5VzUPrA	5	This place is fantastic. I moved from Tucson a few months ago and spent some time looking at different (and affordable) vets.  This is the first place I took my dog (April) to and the staff is wonderful  helpful and attentive.  April (who is 10 yrs old) got her teeth cleaned by Dr. Svoboda and naturally I was extremely nervous dropping her off (because of her age and she has valley fever) so the vet tech had the Dr come to the room beforehand and walk me through the whole procedure. She came out of it better than ever!!  Also  during her first exam he didn't try to do a bunch of unnecessary tests with outrageous prices  which is another HUGE reason why I am making this her permanent vet!
6IbqGzD8O0ne9PyeTuA36g	4	I only called and emailed them about a possible car inspection and buying a car... They were polite and helpful. I also found out that they sell cars too  at http://www.zenithautolv.com/inventory/. Having them guarantee these cars would give me the confidence to buy one from them. Mostly what they have though  that is affordable is  Honda Accord sedans. So this is the place to buy if you are looking for a sedan!  I am hoping that someday they will get some hatchbacks in. :-)
70KkVpjziF8QFpZPwAfB9A	5	Okay guys what the hell... did you open up the transmission and fix it or did you put the timming belt back on like just right? It's seriously never ran this great before it used to not shift gears very well at all now it drives like a dream and all you supposedly fixed was the radiator?  I don't believe it my friend. Will be back for some more of that magic touch!
UZq9Rv0bP-iurfd2fd8EWA	5	Can someone be passionate about junk removal?  Let me tell you:  Super Junk is the gold standard of removing your Junk.  When most people think of Junk removal  thoughts of sketchy or unprofessional people often come to mind.  Super Junk flips that on its head.  Eric and his partner were one of the kindest and most professional service persons that I have ever encountered  and it was for hauling away crap.  Eric and the Super Junk crew showed up super promptly and took care of everything without hesitation or complaint.  If someone quotes you a bit less for some reason  don't be fooled.  There are differences in service quality in all professions  even junk removal.
vBC3z2mbF2LwcLGg7zApZg	5	I came in to have my cracked screen on my iPhone repaired. Akila  was very helpful and took care of me right away. My iPhone looks brand new. Definitely stop here and he will take care of you.
10LZJlcZmVWtMIKhcFtvcg	5	My husband and I decided to try this company due to all the wonderful reviews and we're happy we did! They were able to come out the very next day after we called for an estimate. They were kind  professional  quick  and reasonably priced. We will definitely use them again in the future.
j97Ug0JtQOySb0k4QsS7Ug	5	Best prices  showed up right on time  super fast and professional. Would definitely recommend!!
XZzQVPBG4waloGGiplFWzQ	4	Update: Apparently has been sold to new owners. Still decent  but none of the original and exotic flavors like the previous owners. Standard fare gelato but not the destnation place it used to be. Changed to four stars.
PtzjQvFKJCBOEC6COoe6jQ	5	Got the whole house special which included carpet and tile cleaning. And I must say that I got a steal of a deal. Very happy with the work they did. They are very professional and allow you to walk through the house and you just tell them if they missed a spot (of course they didn't miss anything). Opted to come back when they were done. They texted me 30 minutes prior to being done  which I appreciated. Tiles look nice and clean and carpets are too. Definitely will use them again in the future.
i0Ty5ReRbvRpZcAZJrPuhA	5	Very easy to work with at every level.  We went to a couple other places and got a few estimates at the house.  We selected Affordable because the price was significantly lower  the product seemed similar  and I had heard good things about the installers.  Everything happened perfectly.  The installers worked hard for 3 days.  Moved my furniture  friendly  and didn't mind my hovering.  The company even checked in by phone to see how it was going.  The best part is the quality work and finished product.  I've no hesitation in recommending this company.
FKgsXp7z_Jp7cYmo8jl3Pw	5	Patrick was awesome. Very friendly and professional. Made the carpets look beautiful. Will def use them again!
7f1GmEIMAP9myUaef8BKgw	5	First time here. Delicious Oreo coffee ice cream. I got a sundae and my husband had the waffle cone. Everything is made fresh there. The guy helping us was so helpful and POLITE!! DEFINATELY WILL BE BACK.
EU4h_zDcBIGqVsnKuNOxig	5	This place was awesome!  If your live or visiting Pittsburgh this is a must see attraction!
BNG3EFhIrRABy0Lwh-Ehgg	5	My second time using them. Had lots of mud tracks  olive tree tracks and an ugly plumbing mess on our carpets. Joe and Michel took time in identifying the problem areas with me. During the cleaning they double checked my satisfaction of each area. All spots are clean and I didn't have to pay a ridiculous price. Plus THEY DIDN'T TRY TO UPSELL ME LIKE ALL CARPET CLEANERS DO WHEN THEY STEP IN YOUR HOUSE! Great company. I highly recommend.
dIMYJXmFGuKBW8H4gtPaFw	5	The theater is difficult to find  but the show is very entertaining.
93a_KO6IUxO8DaUIhD6K9g	5	Best ice cream in Las Vegas  definitely! The cashier was super friendly and pleasant  and the ice cream was wonderful. Watch out for the large sizes though  they don't give you scoops  but rather pack the entire cup. I recommend the chocolate and bacio  the bacio is a Nutella hazelnut that taste like a light chocolate  while the chocolate is a lot darker.
0P7omsFSRwrkJA7fJbSFUw	5	Ice cream was great. Lady working there was really nice. I can't think of a reason why they can't just get the full 5 stars. Wish they were closer but having cravings of their flavors and will definitely return.
zjGIMlJITiqyw3Ge4VCPBw	1	OnTrac is not a company that can satisfactorily accommodate its delivery orders (based on my experience and other reviews). I was told by their customer rep that a package has up until 11pm to deliver and they would leave it at my front door. Clearly  companies like Amazon should take notice to this practice as it may be a liability for replacing stolen items. Up way too late waiting for a package... No Bueno!
YcGzxHZqaX3_rAtbkKJ08Q	5	I am very picky about who does my eyebrows! So with that being said I highly recommend Farida's place. I've gotten threaded by her and Asra and they both do great work. They even recommended for me to use castor oil on my eyebrows to make them fuller. Their prices are extremely affordable. They can easily charge more for the quality work they do. I'm so happy I have a them to trust with my eyebrows! :)
7Rkxe9CnWznrChulQvbaAQ	5	Needed a plumber to come out and change a main shut off value and replace the hose bib. I called Rich and he was to my house within the hour. He was very friendly  personable  professional  honest  and knowledgeable. Rich's work was done great and did not try to up sale any other work. Will use again if ever in need!
m5gLOb5w49lRHkhSx2-aCQ	5	My wife and I are expecting and trying to get the nursery together when we discovered that one of our dogs has been using the spare bedrooms as there personal potty rooms. We needed new carpet and fast! I found affordable flooring through yelp and went to the show room  we were in and out of there within 1 hour with carpet  padding and an install date set. We paid 1/3 the price that was quoted  by HD and Lowes. They came and installed the carpet yesterday and were on time  fast professional and clean! It was a pleasure doing business with Travis and his associates! I would definitely do business with them again before I go any where else!!!
ahZb5LqhjRMnx2EMo04tdw	5	I have been a client at Glo Medspa for over year  mainly for botox.  Yesterday  I saw Megan for micro-needling.  Megan did a great job!   She was very thorough with her explanation of the procedure  attentive  and highly professional.  I would certainly recommend Megan if you're searching for an aesthetician.
GbWpBfVeWPS17xLetrJkiQ	5	Called today after going to yelp to find a good pest company i can trust and the House Dr had great views so i gave them a call. I thought i might have a termite problem but after a few questions from Dave he figured it wasnt termites i have but crickets! Dave even walked me through google pics to ensure what i saw. He also gave me a great price and worked with my schedule to get an appt set for next week. If i go w the other reviews i pretty sure the service will be great too! If not i will repost but doubt i will have too. Give them a call if you need a pest co.
cUDtuMhj6yhm0e8STzxHsg	5	Nice lady who helped us. She took her time and did a nice job. Not thin not thick juts perfect clean up.
oReZggZGnAeHGO-XTlyj2w	5	This was my 4th cleaning...LOVE THEM!!! I have used for both carpet and mattress cleaning. The staff ROCKS...so nice and professional. Special shoutout to Jeremy & Joe who just did a beautiful job on my home carpet today. See you guys in another 6 months. THANK YOU  YOU'RE THE BEST.
-h2eAKXhlZAZq8J7j38KQw	1	This is the worst carrier I've ever had the displeasure of working with.  My package wasn't able to be delivered for the first two days due to the driver not being able to get into the gate at my condo.  I've NEVER had this issue with any carrier or any delivery  as there is an easy-to-use terminal at the front where you can contact the condo unit owner by phone.    Nevertheless  I called and submitted an online form to include my gate code  and was assured that my package would be delivered the next day.  Same thing happens the next day.  I call customer service  and it turns out the driver was never  paged  the gate code.  I tell them to send the driver back today.  They refuse to do so as it's not a medical product.  I spoke to a manager who said the same thing.  I sincerely hope that Amazon receives enough complaints to stop utilizing this hack of a carrier.  Do yourself a favor and don't give them your business.
VQqyH4ZpCiC7kYVEnDw-yQ	5	I just went to have my brows cleaned up yesterday. I was nervous because I always go to the same girl in chandler but due to distance I wanted to find someone closer. I can't say enough about how convenient and hassle free walking in was.  Prompt service  great pricing and most importantly well threaded brows.  Farida was very kind and gentle.  I believe she will be opening a new salon in the same area check her out!!!
_1-NfkZLyQ63Li7pIb98CA	5	Shomari slayed my brows! Thanks for the great experience! I'll definitely be coming back!
zYwmO_M7DY0nIyewKwmYdQ	1	All of my online shopping accounts had a notation to never  ever  ever  ship anything to me through OnTrac.  I have had packages stolen from in front of my door on 3 separate occasions.  I live in an apartment and my front door is in a heavy traffic area.  There are 4 other apartments that face mine and all of the 3rd floor has to pass by my door to get to their apartments.  I called OnTrac to report the theft and they said it is the  driver's discretion  if they leave it at the door  even though my door is in a high traffic area and my office accepts packages.    Another time OnTrac delivered my package early  yay!  Except I didn't answer my door because they delivered on a SUNDAY and the delivery driver banged on my door yelling  HELLO!  HELLO? HELLO! .  UPS has delivered to my home after 8 PM and has always identified themselves as UPS  but not OnTrac.  I don't open my door unless I am expecting company and certainly not when it sounds like the person wants to murder me.    Since I have had 3 packages stolen from their deliveries  you think they would make a note on my address to not leave it at the door.  I have even left notes saying please deliver to the front office and the driver was too lazy to walk the 20 yrs to the office.  Avoid them at all costs!
C9WuSNiduNytLGyx35BEVg	5	Came the same day!  Honest and you can tell he loves doing what he does.  I would give him ten stars!  He wasn't able to get the job done because of some other issues that he came across.  I loved the honesty and he didn't even charge us even though he was at the house for about three hours.  He recommended someone for us to fix the problem and we will definitely have him come clean the ducts once the other problem is fixed!  I highly recommend him!!
_N0x9dJk8pdNuWEMfA_B4Q	5	Excellent  timely service! Rich made a special trip to look at my water heater  then installed a new one the next day... He answered my questions and addressed my concerns  which as a woman home owner I especially appreciated. I recommend this company highly  and will use them again for other needs.
dANJ5Gy0bFC4Ob7fcRTFPQ	5	Issues with main drain  had a different company come out and they gave us bad info  I saw the van  liked that they take care of Vets  called and Rich came out immediately after I couldn't get the other company to call me back (for a week). He showed us two breaks  instead of the one the other guys found. Super fast response  super fair pricing. This is going to be a big project and I fully trust Rich to knock it out.
WV0nBSOFvR7KecYOsHP7Gw	5	David Ramos is the guy I use when I need an infestation inspection on one of my listings. What reminded me is of his treatment or consideration of my last inspection I had him do today. As the home is set up he could have said yeah we need to treat  but being the honest guy he is  he found no activity and just billed me for the inspection. Hey these folks are hurting just like everyone else right now and it would have been real easy to lie and no one would know any difference.   So if you need monthly treatment for your home  give him a try. He is a nice honest hard working guy.
Zql0Fo789fRGbtGVs4X7Lw	2	First of all I would like to say the guys who came to pack our stuff up were great and worked all night. The guys who delivered our stuff were great too.   We also moved around Christmas and we moved to western Montana in winter.   That being said be warned....know how much cubic feet of stuff you have. That is crucial.   We originally received an estimate for 1300 cubic feet. We had basically two apartments to move. A few months later we called them to set up a date for pick up and they could not find the estimate. They had no record of it and the guy we originally spoke to was no longer employed there.  So I stayed on the phone while at work with a gal who had only been working for them for 2 weeks. An hour later we came to basically the same cubic feet. They quoted $4900. The day arrives and their guys arrive at 6pm on a Sunday. It turns out we had a lot more than 1300 cubic feet. More like 3200 cubic feet. Oh and packing up stuff was not included in new estimate.   So our $4900 quote was more like $13 000! And if I sent them away I would lose my deposit. With the possibility of escrow closing in less than a week we were stuck. So we used them.   We had to use their boxes at $6.00  a piece and had to pack our own kitchen stuff. We had multiple pieces of furniture with glass in it and were charged extra for those pieces because the gal didn't included them in the  quote .   We had more stuff than would fit in the truck so they would have to send another truck to get the rest. I hounded them on when that day would be. They showed up after we had hit the road so our awesome real estate agent met them there to get the rest almost a week later.   We were told we could call a week in advance and change the delivery date. I called on 8 days ahead of time and changed the date. 3 days later I get a call saying oh well your stuff is already on the truck and they will be there by the weekend.   We got everything unloaded and the fun began. We had lots of totes. Many of them crushed. Gouges in a few pieces of furniture. Boxes crushed even if they said fragile. I have never seen anything like it.   It was a comedy of errors. I have never had to use a moving company before. I hope I won't have to again.   Would I use them again. No. I knew the reviews were bad but I was hoping to give them the benefit of the doubt. I don't know if all companies are like this.   When they pick up your stuff they take it to their warehouse and unload it. Then they reload it on to another truck to send it to you. Maybe it would be different if it stayed on the truck and went straight to you.
zOkSN9ZzkkI7mubJ2yjjMA	5	Excellent service.   We are selling our vehicle  and it needed to be detailed. My husband used to work in demolition  and the interior is a very light grey. We contacted them through Yelp  and made an appointment for the next day. Two guys came to my place of employment  and spent about an hour and a half on the interior. They got all of the little nooks and crannies  and cleaned the carpets. The driver's side floor was dirty around the edges of the floor mats. I could not believe how clean they got the carpet. I should have taken 'before' photos.   I was very pleased with the work they did. I received a call when they arrived  and another when they were done. I paid with a credit card  and was sent a receipt through my email. I would highly recommend The Best Detail.
bUoFnhKphh4GGj-j3DA_SQ	5	These guys Rock! The Limousine's stereo system was showing a bad code and sounded terrible after a different company installed a DVD player. Sounds great now! Thank you
iMxXiR9La3E_OI_pMNPROw	5	Thanks to Yelp I found Peter who made my 2013 Acura TL sparkle like the day I got her! He made all the dog hair disappear and came to my house - so convenient! Definitely worth it and I will be a repeat customer for sure!
SL5TdSK7PkWud_pnvXIS0Q	1	Now I see why they are rated so low!!! Can't believe this. Made an a pickup request Saturday. Was told after 9am on Monday Called about 11:00 and was told... Oh  we pick up between 9-5. Called again at 3:30 and was told   We only pick up in your area between 3-5  Would have been nice to have gotten this information up front so I could have kept my other appointment or rescheduled them....like Fed Ex a lot better!!! So if you do go with them as for a firm time...and good luck!!!
IT4oMZM9g2uyA4S39Kzgnw	5	Charles was fantastic!  Very knowledgeable and took the time to explain everything.  Was extremely pleased with the results.  I have been to other places and didn't have the amazing results I received at Glo. I now have my new favorite place to get my facial treatments!
yIdh3sVKH2Mvz8venxm7IQ	1	Jesus once said: :Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.  Maybe Cox must apply this principle to their own poor service before running down other companies in their adverts!  I scheduled an online appointment for the installation of a Contour DVR. The confirmation email was received  but the appointment never honored. No calls or email to apologize for not showing up.  On calling their help-desk and giving them the order reference #  they just said they cannot see such an order  pulled up their shoulders with a  sorry   - and that's that.  Reading all the reviews on this page  one just realizes that Cox does not care a damn about customer service. Bad  bad  bad!!!!
HZXqQTrvjX3JN7D54bR_gA	5	Soooo...My carpet was ruined by pet urine & random stains & Rick  the owner/worker  did an amazing job getting all of it out. My carpets look brand new! & he gave me an affordable price as well. My last carpet cleaning cost me over $200 for a small one bedroom apartment & when I was searching for carpet cleaners everyone quoted me insane prices without even looking at my apartment. I'm so thankful I found Carpet Monkeys. Definitely coming back.   Rick did a fantastic job & I definitely recommend this company.
PcoBZ03gV_LlmKUqVP_bYQ	5	Had to post another review because I just can't get enough of this place. I've had my eyebrows done by Shaina and Victoria and you just can't go wrong with either one of them. They have slightly different styles but they are both professional and masters at what they do. The front desk staff is also great. They now do eyelash extensions and the pics look great  I'll be trying that service next. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to feel and look good. Get your nails done at a nail salon but don't go there for your eyebrows. I'm telling you spend the extra money and go to Pink Cherry for any and all of your waxing needs.
7WTVyXCUVfr6Z3QI3CIHew	5	Was wanting an ice cream place that didn't serve soft serve and wasn't a chain.  I Googled 'the best ice cream places'  in Arizona and Mighty Moo came up and saw all the positive reviews.  I took my boyfriend there and we were amazed with all the flavors they had to offer and how damn good the flavors tasted.  I ended up telling two of my other friends about it and we went again the next day.  The banana cream pie and sweet corn raspberry swirl are delicious!  Would recommend this place for sure if you're looking for a unique ice cream joint.
nWlqPJYVlxURvM6WOUG4-w	1	I have been a loyal Cox customer for 15-20 years. I have cable ( a big pckg.)  telephone  and internet. My bill runs $300/mo. so over my time w/them they have certainly made at least $50 000.00. BUT THEY TREAT MY LIKE TRASH. They sent a tech here last week who was aggressive  scary  threatening  and he refused to replace a DVR box that not only wasn't functioning  but had been  red flagged  for all customers b/c Cox knew they were defective and didn't work. He then left with my garage wide open  my phone box ripped apart  my cable boxes all over the house and my custom cabinets empty.  It took 2 hours on hold and being passed around by Cox--just to get his employee i.d. to lodge a complaint. I lodged the complaint last week. I was told by Cox corporate a manager would get back to me immediately. No one has called or made any contact w/ me. I have now been told by another tech--who came to switch out the defective box yesterday--that the tech I had has  Lots of complaints .  If Cox knows they have a dangerous employees out there terrorizing their customers  and damaging their cabinets and systems  why do they try so hard to protect them? It shouldn't take 2 hours on the phone to get the name ( or i.d. number) of who they send to your home.   My attempts to talk to management about the issue have gone nowhere.  And as I stated at the beginning  I am a large customer--a big account. Just imagine how they treat small accounts.
d99X7lZ-ZUHO63h2nKDYcQ	5	Great service! Carpets look great. Would definitely recommend to a friend and will use again in the future!
NagFUS-KnLXSAUDVFyYIqA	5	Called and talked to Jim (the owner) about adding some sensors to my existing system at my office. We talked about I wanted/needed but recommended that the installation tech come out to take a look to give his opinion on what the best course of action would be for my needs. He scheduled the tech to come out the next business day and check things out. After having the tech  Vince  look over my office  we discussed what I wanted vs. what he thought would be best. His recommendations saved me a few bucks as where he proposed we put sensors eliminated some of the ones I thought I needed. All my interactions with JPG have been handled in a professional and timely manner and I can't recommend them enough for anyone's security needs.
CHICycjEnVzK3DeDtRRAjA	5	Very professional  prompt service. Jason came out had the problem fixed in no time. Would definitely recommend and will be recommending to anyone who needs a plumber. And he was very clean and left no mess behind.
uNlHBIhfGuyy4J6u6rcNxg	1	I have Cox for my internet and live in the 92104 are of San Diego - for more than a year I have experienced a weak signal and techs have come more than six times - each telling me that the cables are outdated and squirrels eat through the coating causing a disruption in service.  They even convinced me to rent a wireless modem from them and still  the problem continues. I pay a premium price for this service and at my wits end on what to do...if anyone has a better provider please post that carriers name.  I am scheduled for another tech to come and  fix  the problem.  What ever happened to getting what you paid for in this world????  I had to reconnect three times to write this review.
e40FjYfdR-bfkz0J05iWLQ	5	Writing this review after my 5th time coming here. This place is amazing. I've had the kiss tacos and the Chicken nachos and both hit the spot! The employees there are super nice and provide great service.
hPvrW9IW5T_W-kDgVg_pKw	5	I was very surprised to see a cleaning service get such awesome reviews but after doing such a fantastic job on my tile and grout floor I agree this company definitely deserves five stars! I definitely recommend using this company
pq1tbzgthHE4OE5eZPTNdQ	5	I love going here.  I have been to Bryan Goddard twice for haircuts now and he has done amazing work both times.  I get really nervous when going to a new stylist but he did a great job with the consultation and then doing a very good cut.   I think he is awesome b b
XLrc16EciCAywWV4nlwh5A	5	This place is really great. The staff is efficient and professional. I was so happy I got a great price on my jewelry.
gvFvNC4WTJHBCFDtgTw33w	4	This guy Vic is hilarious! Just an added bonus to his very innovative menu of hotdogs and brats.  Maybe not the best place for the faint of heart as the Chili man speaks freely (very freely) and doesn't really give a s***.  I got he the Chili Man's choice and vinegar bomb  chips and a drink all for under $8 and was very pleased with my meal.  Only down side I can think of here is that his lines get really really long so try to get there before noon on nice days.  Other than that its just something you gotta try if you're in Uptown.  Nothing more to say but I will be back!
I8XQT_9RzOziTR3N4OYiyQ	5	I highly recommend Omar's window tinting  I was browsing and calling around to a few different locations  but Omar was the one who provided the best quality work for the most reasonable pricing. I was able to call and get a the time that worked for me. I got my 2012 Chevy Sonic tinted. All 4 windows including the rear view window. Friendly service  shows you the chart of tint to pick from  and gets the job done quick with excellent quality and pricing.
HKR80jVqrd8KWKpNnF3dgQ	5	Joe did a great job on my carpets and my sofa for a great price and a smile The owner  Rick  not only got me a quote in record time through Yelp  but also responded to a question of mine that I emailed with a phone call in under a minute. I couldn't ask for anything more from a carpet cleaning service.
gY2umwtTf2EhuvbgmM-GMw	5	Matthew does a excellent job. Professional  honest  friendly  and affordable. I recently had my roof replaced and the roofers left a screen over my exhaust vent that quickly clogged up. He quickly found problem and cleaned out the vent and restored the proper flow. Highly recommended.
X370hbuIV-jA9JFI161sVw	1	Complete misrepresentation. Originally quoted one price and it went up by almost double upon delivery.  Dishonest and unprofessional. Should have trusted the negative reviews  but when I questioned it  was told that the company was under new ownership.  Will definitely be doing more research if I am ever in need of moving services again.
wd_JdZOvGMqLljR4G0sauA	5	This is a long overdue review.   Max automotive is the best place you can take your vehicle to for repairs.   We had recently taken our 2001 explorer to a local dealership to look at and they quoted us over 2k to fix a supposedly broken condenser.   We were in a pinch and couldn't afford to shell out that much prior to a road trip to California with my family.   I reached out to Max and they were super helpful and got us in right away and quickly found out that the issue had nothing to do with the condenser and was simply a case of replacing some manifold hoses that were leaking.  600 bucks later we were good to go!  These guys are first class honest folks who go the extra mile to help you.   I would highly recommend them to any of my friends in a heart beat.  Thanks guys for helping fix our vehicle!
2SZnmWZc0A2LLnSTIyOkBA	5	This is one of the few comics who kept me laughing throughout the show. He is a bundle of energy & smiles. I've seen a lot of comedy routines in the Atlanta area & a few in Vegas  & this is the one I recommend. I got one of his DVDs as well!
eah5t_B93yemo2HWPy7xng	5	Shaina was flawless! Super friendly and made sure I got exactly what I wanted out of my eyebrows. Pink Cherry Wax was a cute and clean store  and I'll definitely be going there again!
dNrwAv7zUrOlVopQwDQixw	5	Fast  reliable  affordable. Rick the owner is very professional and makes sure I'm always satisfied. He has done several of my properties and always makes them look like new.
pPLBZmbGFPIBKIhgKFtn9w	5	Unfortunately  the house we purchased and fell in love with has carpet. I say  unfortunate  because we are dog lovers. We own two French Bulldogs that we are obsessed with. The only problem is... Dogs + Carpet =  Gross. Period. They shed. They track in dirt. They slobber. They snort. They wiggle. They're basically two little piggy-poos that live with us. Oink. Oink.  What's a girl to do? Oh yeah... Call Nobel Cleaners. They're the best.   There's a reason they have a gazillion five star reviews. It's because they're incredible. We've used their services twice and both times they were extremely thorough  prompt  professional  friendly  and provided a quote and stuck to it. In fact  they over quoted us and upon completion of their work charged us less. Yeah  they're top-notch carpet superheroes.   If your carpets are looking less than dapper and are needing some TLC... give these carpet superheroes a call. They will come to your rescue and have your carpets looking brand new in no time! They're piggy-poo approved.
aER5Zroxg3A1ypoKrvZsHg	5	My husband and I used this wonderful company for our new home. (Just moved to NV.) Keeping it simple  he's quick and good with his work. Very happy with our water softener  and our instant hot water. Got no issues from the beginning so I give them full five stars. Thank you so much again.
j0XG9zNfu4qpGRaMOVdQVA	5	Always 5 star service! Had the unfortunate experience of a hit and run in an employee casino parking lot. We used LVCC before and I knew I'd only take my car to them because of their stellar reputation and quality of work. It took about 5 days and my car is as good as new. Mark  Mara  Felix - they're all amazing. You can't even tell where the damage was done. They detail your car inside and out  and they even give you a small bottle of paint for touch ups. They even took me home after I dropped off my car. They truly go out of their way in the name of service. Thank you guys  and as I said  love you but I hope I never see you at the shop again.
Bj_eA-YTiZqAXJgtlUZ0Kg	5	Rich did a fantastic job. This was the second time we needed his help. He not only had a fair price  he used quality products to repairs 3 bathroom faucets.  His appearance is professional as well as his work. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
xLM15DkfQeSAi2NzmUZ6hw	5	My girlfriend and I made the trek from South Charlotte.  Wow  was it worth it  worth the wait  Holy Cow!  We couldn't decide what to get  so we both got two.  The life changer is just that.  I lived in Chicago as a teenager  and USED to think a Chicago dog was the best there is...no longer.  Chili man's life changer is the best hot dog I've ever had.  Can't wait to go again.  I think he's right  my husband may have a problem with this  but I may be waking up in the night saying   Chili man  that's a life changer 
QfFt7-rT1htqf6rPdJK7wQ	5	Does great carpet cleaning worth it. May not be cheap but you get what you pay for fast and quick response! Does get tuff stains out !!
M_fk2KenpbyQ2gzVXw6b2g	5	I have used Peter for all my vehicles and will not use anyone else. The attention to detail he provides in his services is the reason I refer him to everyone I talk too. He is an expert with black vehicles and will make them shine again. Trust me when I say you won't be disappointed.
4iv3748MNoG7cwEPKBLw7w	5	Super nice guy  easy to work with. Went out of his way to make sure I was happy. He also had the best price. His competitors quoted me more and were not at all flexible.  I was so happy I tipped him an extra $10
LhMrJCTulPQxLUMk-64HqQ	5	Yummy treats! Great spot. Very friendly folks
fhL3_mTR3ITXrJa-UZmjXg	5	If you need your dryer vent cleaned (and I can't imagine you'd be on Yelp reading this if you didn't) stop now and call Matt at Northstar.    The work ethic this man had was inspiring and he charges a ridiculously fair price for the work he's doing.  Let me tell you my experience:  I called Matt and he told me he'd try to get by that night because the rest of his schedule wasn't going to work for me.  When he couldn't make it  he called and apologized profusely before agreeing to squeeze me in the next day even though he'd have to go WAAYYYY out of the way (Litchfield Park to me in Ahwatukee).  He showed up and got to work.  It turns out my house has the world's worst setup for a dryer vent.  After several hours it was very late and he was unable to crack the clog.  He refused to take my money even though he spent almost 4 hours working.  He told me what I needed to do in order to find the clog.  The next day  he came back out and we were able to get the gunk cleared.   He loves what he does  he cares about your safey  he's a small business owner  and he will be easy to deal with.  This is the type of guy/business I love to support.
d20hN_Ru9CWRpeYZOv4_-w	1	Sucks!  I got screwed by this company several times.   First  a sales guy knocked on my door and made a whole list of promises that weren't true.  I was being charged about $40 a month more than I was told.  He also told me that if I was unhappy that I could just cancel anytime.   Well  that was another lie.  When I tried to cancel  I was told I was in a 2 year contract and will be charged a huge bullshit fee.   So  I was with them for about year  paid more than I was told and have to pay $150 to cancel.  Just a crappy company.
kleVCcb0SaWRueQ0UFYh8A	1	Ontrac is horrible  STAY AWAY!!! I am still  waiting for my package that was supposed to be delivered two days ago. They haven't even had the decency to alert me to the fact that my package would be late  it just hasn't shown up. DO not USE Ontrac!
WVshK4Odew6-XlHklXeozw	5	They did a great job on both my carpets and my sectional. They showed up on time  we're very professional and did a great job. I will definitely use them again in the future.
bsq_hMbIS0gVo63yvNnPWg	5	Amazing service!!!!! Would recommend to everyone needing body work!!! I came here because I was rear ended by another driver. This shop was covered under the insurance company and I was very happy to see all the good reviews  especially because all the other shops listed by the insurance had crappy reviews. I called to ask when to come in and they were very helpful and polite. They made the whole process so quick and easy. They looked over the car quickly and gave me a quick estimate in how long I would wait to get it back. They also called hertz and arraigned for them to pick me up. I received an estimate of repairs and completion date very quickly. I got the car back in about a week. The car came back looking like new. They even buffed out other unrelated minor scratches on my car. The car came back throughly cleaned as well and looking great. While insurance covered me and I didn't have to pay out pocket I will most definitely use them for any future auto body repair and will gladly recommend them to anyone else I know needing body work. They are a very well run and honest company that will get the job done. Getting in a crash and dealing with the stresses of it can sometimes be a pain and they made this part of it a very good experience. Bravo LVCC
HbrqjDoGMjh_4AI32PjiFg	5	The ultimate gelato paradise! They offer an array of mouthwatering  high quality gelato which are always deliciously decadent and wildly unique. I mean  come on  creamy sweet corn gelato or spicy rocoto chili & pimento cheese gelato!? These two captured my heart and my tastebuds. The very first bite you'll just want to close your eyes in sweet reverie and savor the magical treat.  I've also had the pleasure of trying the incredibly rich fior di latte (milky mozzarella) -holy cow it's so luscious and creamy! The beautiful basil gelato is super icy and also uber refreshing on a scorching hot day. Pistachio gelato is very creamy and nutty. Plus  the chai tea latte is milky and comforting. Oh! and for the outrageous and adventurous palates - how about steak and eggs gelato?! Yup  they often offer bizarre and unheard of flavors that are just as great as conversational pieces and as for taste? Spot on!   I'm constantly finding myself daydreaming about trying new flavors on my next visit at AOF! Until next time  my dreamy goddess!
fqb0kc7GBQkxh6e1OidAwA	2	(Late review)  Summer of 2015  I took a 2016 Subaru WRX in for install work.  I intended on purchasing a mono amp  install accessories  and paying for labor.  Approx 1 000 miles on the new car.  I provided new in box Infinity Kappa 6.5  speakers for the doors (front and rear.  Provided a new in box Inifinty 12  sub.  One (4) channel class D Alpine amp for the doors.  All products were first market products AKA purchased from Crutchfield.  I had a 12  enclosure from the Mercedes that I had just traded in.  Purchased an Alpine Mono amp from the store.  Paid for the install dropped off the vehicle.  My memory is about $700 +/-.  At 2 PM  I got a call from the store.  Cool I thought  my new toys are all set.....I was told that the sub was bad right out of the box...As I lived in NW Peoria at the time  I didn't want to stop at this point as the drive was cumbersome from my house to Sun Valley.  What are my options I ask....He makes a few suggestions and while I am not a fan of Alpine subs  I purchased the sub over the phone.  I was about to hang up when he indicated that my enclosure was a bit flimsy for said Alpine sub.  Again  not wanting to call it off  I was priced and agreed to pay.  Another few hours and I head back and get my car  paid the difference.  I think I am at $1 000 spend now  outside the eternal cost of the  Crutchfiled gear.  (Box up the 'bad' sub and send it back - yes I got a refund on the sub after I paid to ship it back; shipping subs is not cheap)  Hop in my new car.  I'm pumped!  No more lame Subaru stereo speakers - all mid to high end Infinity and Alpine!!!!!  Now  it's July and 100 degress in PHX.  AC on like a champ.  Stereo on.....  AC right off....Even at 40  my ears could hear what I will call low level noise.  Please do not confuse this with a grounding issue; it was low level static like noise.  I want to get home as today has not gone my way.  Perhaps it will go away - we've all heard the urban legend of 'breaking in' speakers...  Next day I awake like a child on 25 December to play!!!  Car on - stereo on but volume at zero.  There it is the low level noise.  Ah man  this is not going well.  Car off  paper for notes  DB meter app on my phone downloaded.  I take static readings with just the ambient noise in my garage as a baseline.  I take an interior DB reading inside my car  engine off.  Repeat now with engine on for baseline  inside my garage noise.  Now turn on radio power  volume on zero  DBs increase.  OK  I'm not making this up  low level noise (as I call it) is present.    Take a day off work (no  I am not complaining about using vacation time just sharing) and go back as they are expecting me.  Ryan I believe was my salesman and he's ready for me at about 10 am (my memory)  So  they consider different LOCs to no avail.  Consider something like LOC amp part to no avail.  They concluded that the Alpine 4 channel  class D amp  was the culprit; they indicated that it's understood that they can be noisy.  Now  my last stereo was 100% JL audio save for the deck and speaker wire - Amps JL  speakersJ L  JL  loaded enclosure  JL amp install kit  JL clean sweep.  As this car was my toy  and relatively inexpensive car  I didn't want to 10% of the price of the car in stereo gear  so I didn't want a $2 500 stereo.  (Purchase price of car $25 000)....  So Ryan  what do we do I ask....He suggests a JL amp....ok I say.  Do it.  He gets the same results.  Ryan  what do we do now?  He suggests a higher end JL amp.  I grin and bear it.  My spend was about $150 on the original Alpine.  I end it with a XD 400 and a spend of about $500 after tax.  Oh and the day and a half of anxiety and frustration...Guess what didn't go away?  The low level noise.  Shame on me  I go back a 3rd time for tweeters....I think  maybe somehow this will fix?  No.  :(  Why am I writing this now?  I traded in the subject vehicle for the same car just newer.  I've got the amps from SVS on my counter and I am shopping for a shop to install.  However  I am gun-shy about going back.  If this happens again  what's the solution?  Perpetually getting more and more expensive gear?  I do find it odd that so many parts had issues.  I can see one noisy amp or one bad Inifinity sub ...But all these solutions and the noise remained but my money didn't.  Look for the picture I took as validation of my check in.  It's the 4th picture in the Yelp pics and it's of the sign on a rainy August morning.
B1c-KFKf11RNBpiH5-Hj5g	5	Just perfect! Many constantly changing flavor choices  all perfectly and passionately made. Prices are just right.
518_7VaTLwtH4IbKlivgzg	5	First of all  five stars simply because the guy working the counter let me try every single flavor. Second  he did it with such enthusiasm I actually thought he was the owner for a minute. He is clearly passionate about the product and the business and was a lot of fun! Now. Onto the ice cream. Today's special flavor was Funyun. I tried it so I can say I've had it. They had tons of flavors! I had vanilla cherry with a scoop of ding dong. My father in law had the buttermilk strawberry (the best strawberry ice cream I've ever had). My mother in law had the mint chip  which used real mint and was so good! My husband had a reverse root beer which had root beer ice cream in cream soda... Seriously! So anyways  go here. Enjoy. Support this fantastic local business!
K4HEV5bafOKIeRgGSFSCUA	5	Excellent service  good prices  honest folks. I needed an aux jack installed in an old Tacoma  and they showed me first-hand every option that I had. The job was done quickly  and the system works like a charm. I probably would have paid double for the same service somewhere else.
RX7XWDBliHBmVstuRx2NIg	5	Akila was great! He matched any price for iPhone 6 repair around town. In under 1 hour my phone looks brand new again. Thank you again!
uEwDKluN-u85W6N1qCMhdA	5	We just moved to Las Vegas walked into Best Mattress and was welcomed by  Anjoly  she is amazing!!! Helpful  accommodating  knowledgable so yes... just Amazing!!!!! Delivery same day within the hour we purchased! Delivery guys were great!! Thank you Anjoly!!
LRnZPP-9ByJmSYDoKlYk9g	5	Great Service! My catalytic converter was bad so I had failed emissions  the team at Max Automotive not only got me the best price on OEM parts  they fixed a simple oil leak that another shop told me was a major repair. They also steam cleaned my engine and took my truck through emissions all same day! You cannot beat this kind of service combined with the best prices in town. You guy have a new customer!!!
28MWGe6KywqEq019noWnQg	5	Wow!  I have been holding back for like 6 months from getting eyebrows threaded bcs I've had bad experiences. Just moved here and decided to go with Farida based on great reviews here on yelp.  Must say she is BY FAR the best I've ever been to!!!   Both eyebrows match!!! I told her a little as to how I like them but let her do her thing. She took her time.  Was so impressed when she showed me!  Happy client!!   All the ladies there seemed so nice! Very warm and welcoming!!   Don't go anywhere else!
vI9-pWFq998oUjN6G7d2hg	5	It's no surprise that I am a fan of Art of Flavors and the amazing Desyreé. My visit was alongside veteran Yelpers  so as she was catching up with everyone  she realized it was my first time. That meant immediate sampling of flavors she insisted I try and I was not complaining.  I sampled Strawberry & Thyme  Chocolate  Apple & Asparagus (SorBETTOS) and Strawberries & Cream  Chocolate Almond  Pistachio  Pear & Gorgonzola  Fior di Latte  Green Tea  Maple (GELATOS). Everything was delicious. The gelatos and sorbettos are all extremely creamy with texture perfection. The incredible flavors are well developed  robust without being overpowering or too sweet. It's truly amazing. I am a big fan of gelato  however  I've always been on the fence about sorbet because of its usual sweet and tart characteristics. Art of Flavor's sorbets are nothing like that. There are also flavors that I associate with bad experiences  like pistachio  but their renditions will completely change your mind!  After tasting so many delicious flavors  it was very difficult to make a decision! I finally decided that I wanted to go with the popular Pear & Gorgonzola Gelato with another flavor to accompany it. So  of course I asked for Desyreé's recommendations. She had three combinations in mind depending on my preferences: Cioccolato e Peperoncino (chocolate with pasilla and red chile)  Pistachio  or Chocolate. I sampled the combinations  except the spicy chocolate  and both were really tasty; amazing pairings!  So  I finally settled on Pear & Gorgonzola with Pistachio and it was phenomenal. So  so delicious. Both flavors were wonderful individually  but together  it created a dance on my tastebuds! Toward the end of my cup  I blended the two gelatos together and it was just heavenly.  Seriously  bravo!! This is a true gem and culinary masterpiece. I love the large selection of amazing flavors and I absolutely love the fact that they are constantly creating and experimenting new flavors - it's exciting!  Update (01/18/14): sampled more sorbettos - Raspberry  Mango/Pineapple with Jalapeño  Dill Pickle  Guava and gelatos - Sweet Corn  Parmesan Reggiano  Smoked Salmon. I really enjoyed the Mango/Pineapple sorbetto with Fior di Latte gelato.
BNJyNMsTbrrCe1H22CxZ8g	5	We love this small ice cream shop. We always get wondeful service and the ice cream tastes delicious and natural.  They even have toys to keep the kids entertained.
ZWavuDcQWXdBEL5K9krNdA	5	Hands down the best hot dog I've ever had! It was so good I even went back and got a second one! I flew to Charlotte from Arizona for a bachelorette weekend  and these hot dogs were definitely part of the memorable experience.  He had so many amazing choices including creating your own with a variety of toppings and sauces. Vic was incredibly personable and friendly!
iphrvxU1ebtng6g1RdILBw	5	Exceptional fast service at a fair price. Thank you Omar for helping me be able to see out of my windows without having to roll them down.
cm27AR9RnMZ7B5aVWmzFeg	5	We moved got Carpet Monkeys to clear our carpets when we moved out of our rental place. We have kids and pets so despite  our best efforts we gave the carpets a fair bit of punishment. They did a great job at cleaning the carpets however where the  company really  excelled was in the customer service area when the property manager said they still had an issue with some problem areas. Rick came back and personally cleaned those areas himself when the property manager threatened to withhold our security deposit. He also refused to accept any money from me when I offered to compensate him for the additional effort. Carpets can be tricky so it was great to know that Rick has the integrity to stand behind his work even if it costs him personal time and money to do so. A class act.
DosVtrZ2LXyUi3W6pL31zQ	1	How has a class action lawsuit not been filed against  this company!? I will be reporting them and have an appointment with my attorney next week  and he is very interested in moving forward with this.  Their deadbeat drivers claim to deliver your package  but steal the item instead  knowing that Amazon will cover the customer with a refund or replacement. My  same day delivery  last Monday was supposedly signed for at 7:10pm at the front desk of my complex. The office  however  closes at 5pm so please tell me how this is possible. I opened an investigation with Ontrac the next day  and after jumping through hoops was told that the driver will come back to show me where he apparently delivered the package. Driver was a no show and refused to cooperate with the Ontrac dispatcher. I filed a driver complaint and was told that his manager would call me. That was 8 days ago  and I've contacted them 3 additional times since then...it is literally impossible to get a manager on the phone or get any type of explanation from them as to why no one has contacted me.  Even the dispatchers are trained to advise the customer to just reorder the item...apparently this happens all the time. Never have I had this problem with UPS or Fedex.  Anyone who is interested in discussing this class action lawsuit with my legal counsel please contact me directly.
VdC_LpccXM6vuNGpYONb3Q	5	Had my first visit and Vic is the best. The line was 10 deep at 11:15am and he charmed the crown as we patiently waited for the best chili dog I have ever had. The Boogie Down Dog was so good I wasn't sure that Southern all the way would even come close. Both were outstanding. I will definitely be a repeat customer.
I6hzttgVjzLh_6Jzn888nQ	5	We had our security system installed by JPG about 2 months.  The instructions were simple and easy.  The person who in installed our system was very helpful and courteous.  One of my concerns was keeping my animals safe while we are gone.  I appreciate that He took all of my concerns into consideration.  We have had couple of instances where the alarm went off by accident and we got a call from the security company within seconds.  It is so comforting to have peace of mind while I am away from home.  I highly recommend JPG home security.
8QmqIDI-oNm_q463qvUx8g	5	Got quotes from 3 companies for removal of a King size mattress. It was bulky and hard to move. Eric was the first to quote and gave the best price. They scheduled time Tuesday morning at 7:30 and called 15 minutes before arrival. They were in the house and the mattress was gone in 1 minute. Great guys and highly recommend for junk removal
_3iA1SPEhFg4gPtSL-oR5g	5	This is the best hidden gem in the West Valley! All the ice cream is homemade and you know you're getting the best stuff by the first taste. There are so many delicious flavors to sample. I highly recommend a scoop (or two) of peanut butter explosion! Mighty Moo is family owned and operated. You feel right at home when you walk in the door. We frequent this spot on the weekends because it is some of the best ice cream I've ever had! Support local!
6wvKemBgaGtwH3-jXTt8cA	5	Turns out I reviewed the wrong location that I had visited but coming here has been a GODSEND. I usually ask for Chelse and she is amazing! She takes her time to make sure my eyebrows are how I want and that they aren't too thin. They have a lot of other waxing services and products that I hope to get in the future.
3zFQB5gzU-ThraTSWt9S7Q	5	Matthew was great - very respectful of our time and very nice.  We bought an Angie's List deal for a dryer vent cleaning and it was worth our time and $$.  I would definitely recommend Matthew to anyone.
c8XmVU-8ReiShbOtveo1SA	5	I was extremely pleased with the craftsmanship and customer service I received with this company. They truly are running a business the way it should be. My wife's car was damaged and Las Vegas Collision Center brought it back to factory condition. Thanks for making a bad time a wonderful experience.
UcIL9GuiZrf-FiGCriSbPg	5	I tried Pink Cherry when a girlfriend of mine recommended it. I had never waxed before and was a bit scared to. This place and the ladies that work here are super amazing! They make sure you're super comfortable and at ease. The shop is so adorable and the whole experience is fabulous! I'm a regular now and I don't think I'll ever try another place for any of my waxing needs. This place is nowhere near where I live  but totally worth the drive!
UGJgWd7XabTYVetE8BAF_Q	5	11/16/17: I came here with my iPhone 6 plus screen repair after consulting with multiple other technicians. Akila was very professional  proficient and speedy with his repair. He will subtract $5 from the best price you're quoted elsewhere  though keep in mind he will call and verify. Also  he offers both OEM as well as generic parts at multiple price points. Highly recommended!  Update 11/18/17: After a day of tinkering  I noticed that the original repair left my home button with a slight  but noticeable  wiggle. I also detected a smudge on the upper portion of the interior surface of the replacement glass panel. Which is no negative at all because the takeaway here is that Akila takes pride in his work. He made no excuses and immediately offered to resolve the above issues with no questions asked. I left my phone with him and returned an hour later to find it better than new.
FzBUAHqk_m02QL9mg1RBXw	5	Glo Medspa is great!  Megan is wonderful with peels and my skin has never looked better!  Charles is the BEST with injectibles!  I love his work and he has the nicest staff ever. His new office is very pretty and love the new location as well. Trust me-go to Glo and you won't regret it!!!
R4zF_Z-s-WBs8pLcgENetQ	5	Just hired these guys to clean my carpets from our old rental. I feared that the carpets werent save-able. Joe from Carpet Monkeys walked my house and said no biggie at all. I got you... No extra charges nothing! I could not believe the service I got from this amazing company. They saved me from possibly loosing a large chunk of a security deposit. They showed up on time and did a better job than I could have ever expected. Ask for their technician Joe to come out and do your carpets. He wont disappoint at all! Ill let the before and after photos so you guys the results. They speak for themselves :)
ALbsPlIwGUbJCypVG-bzzQ	5	Another Awesome place to visit in Pittsburgh. Sitting back in an industrial park  this bike store/repair shop/museum ROCKS!!!   Ok  they've got THousands of bikes- and everybody has had one or two if those  right? From the classic Schwinns   to the rare bikes like PeeWee Herman's famous bike from Peewees Bug Adventure. Old bikes  new ones  scooters and a million other strange things to look at.  Plan at least an hour for walking around this maze of interesting items. And most of it is For Sale! Free and worth a lot more!
O1N44WCcb7EopvY4_SalgQ	5	Wow!!! Amazing experience and install in my 71 Chevelle. I got constant updates via Ryan kept me informed of the progress and any suggestion to the build. My system sounds like a professional audio car that goes to competitions. Everything is clean and install spot on. They made fiberglass kick panels and custom box blown through rear deck.   Will bring my other rides here for sure!
eeE73GKWd87mkG8yIdrPVA	5	Very nice and welcoming. I liked how informative my girl was. Their prices are amazing! $8 for brows and $4 for upper lip. Definitely worth it!!
axPpE9-K0JYCyEtHvNtH9w	5	Customer service is off the charts...I had the most pleasant experience; Aaron is definitely open  honest and transparent. I took some jewelry to sell  which included a diamond ring that I'd not worn for many years. I did not sell the diamond ring on the first visit  however after some thought I called him back the next day. They are closed on Wednesday  however he made an appointment with me to come see him on Wednesday; he said it would be best as he could take his time; he would not have customers waiting. He  invested time in explaining what he was checking and what he was doing as he inspected the diamond. After this visit  I decided to sell my ring as I felt confident that I was getting a fair price for it. If I could give Aaron 10 stars I would; I told him I felt a bit unsafe walking to my car  he said if I could wait until he closed the shop up he would walk me to my car  which he did!  Thanks Aaron. As promised  I will stop by to see you on my way out of U.S.A.
6tFzM-heuEW-Lr8vDMXX3g	5	These guys are great! Very professional and genuinely care about doing the job right... wouldn't have expected anything less from a Veteran owned/employed business. My carpet looks fresh and clean again  ready for my visitors next week. They were on time  took a moment to explain the process  asked about problem areas and got to work. They were very friendly and took the time to answer all my questions and ensure I was satisfied with the work. I will definitely use them in the future and spread the word about these guys to my neighbors  friends and co-workers looking to clean their carpet.
2yLJHkB-rkAKG7hra3wR_Q	5	Colburn Enterprises has been fantastic helping with plumbing jobs both at our home and also our small rental property.  Always professional  getting the job done well  and very straightforward and honest;  it's disheartening the price gauging that we've experienced with other plumbers  but never with Colburn Enterprises.  Amber is terrific to deal with on the phone.  Jeremy handled a couple of jobs for us  and we hope to work with John  the owner  for future jobs which will inevitably come up.  Highly recommend.
pWDovjrtprhNJli9G01AbA	5	I found Dr. McAdams on yelp and the reviews here are right on!! I have bounced around from dentist to dentist  and I think I have found the dentist for me. I have had a problem with a tooth for years now and have seen 3 dentists about it. After seeing Dr. McAdams  my tooth was fixed within one week and I am thrilled with the results. He is very honest as well and will give you an update about things that need to get done right away and other things that can wait. I didn't feel like he was trying to sell me something as I have with previous dentists. Highly recommend!!!!
EZmoTf3rEZiVTckOY7mzQQ	5	This was the first time I've ever done waxing. I originally chose them because of their proximity to where I live. But  I will return. The staff was quite friendly  yet professional. I was put at ease throughout the whole process. Everything was explained to me as well as any follow up personal care. Even though it was my first time  I felt like I wasn't treated simply as a customer but almost as an old friend. This place was great!
fQrVSyC1VTG_wYSbJFmDCw	5	Ace really knows hair and can make any guy look well groomed and modern.  I was lucky enough to meet Ace at another salon and even luckier when I found him here. He is a super fit body builder and inspires me to work out and look good just through his example not though his words. No guilt  just a good example and a good life attitude.  I am not sure if he cuts women's hair  but I know he does an excellent job on men's haircuts.
BTjn6nGKqRpfOwLxhY3WUA	5	Melissa and Josh were terrific. So friendly and helpful and very knowledgable. We had a great experience and will gladly recommend this store to others!
u4D1QfDvg87OlWI_zpNGhg	5	Fabulous and Fast!  Wonderfully kind  courteous  truthful and honest! Absolutely the service to use if you have a plumbing issue or any leaky issue!  My leaky kitchen ceiling was due to a air conditioning problem. ...who would have thought that?   Certainly not me!
wsHTr7ELAZcusiTV7axXjw	5	Great job! Got scheduled within 2 days for a carpet and couch cleaning. Michel arrived at first with the normal unit  and realized that a mobile unit would be needed. He quickly called help and the arrived within the next 45 minutes. On top of that  he treated a couple darker spots on my carpet with shampoo free of charge. Patrick was the technician and was polite and did a great job. Purchased with Groupon and was treated like a repeat customer. A+
x7IWKE219s6n19Uolzm4Iw	5	We scheduled Matt to clean out our dryer vent after hearing good reviews on Next Door.  He was on time; very pleasant and explained every step he was going to do to clean out our vent. He cleaned it from the roof and from the dryer side.  He explained that our vent was actually in good shape but he did collect some lint/garbage out of the vent line. While he was on the roof he checked for any loose or cracked tiles!  I would definately use Northstar again for this service.  The price he charged ($69) is a great price for all he does.
5A8NZbTdqPEB5vqbhSVWoQ	5	Shay is absolutely the best. It's been so difficult to find a stylist who could actually cut short hair. If you are tired of searching  go to Shay at 1226 Central Ave. You will be so happy  happy  happy!
Q22DsF_bT76iFvJS2gsZwA	5	Mark did an excellent job on my carpets. All the stains we couldn't get out are now gone. I'll definitely be using them again!
9rjZ8yjjdYypcKBxm4eqxg	5	These guys offer quality work at a very reasonable price.  When my Toyota Corolla needed a new radiator  I was new in town and called ten different shops (including dealership).  Hondoctors were the only independently run shop that would actually tell me what brand radiator that they would use so I could do my own research  but they were also almost the cheapest.  I go to them for my regular oil changes now  and they are excellent.  I drive across town for these guys and they are worth it.  Come here and you will be a regular.
_4f4gbTwzjA1JOpLZF-uQQ	5	i would give 10 stars if possible. I have always been the biggest chicken when it comes to dentists. I have had such bad experiences.   Thanks to the reviews on yelp I found Dr. McAdams. All I can say is WOW! This was the best experience from the appointment process to the actual visit itself.  The staff is so cordial. The place itself is ultra modern.  As it turned out I needed a tooth pulled. I FELT ABSOLUTELY NO PAIN!   The demeanor of Dr. McAdams was so soothing. Candice his assistant was a doll.  I always had to be put out for such a visit  but when I tell you that I walked out in disbelief that the local novacaine did the trick was a dream!    I would HIGHLY recommend this practice.  Again  let me say even 10 stars isn't enough.  Thank you so much Dr. McAdams.
8qAnp52yHj_0z48YCGgWow	5	Great facility and staff.  Family owned and operated with all the newest technology and oh so friendly.  Its like pulling teeth to find something wrong with this establishment....haha     Keep up the good work!  Frank
xE-o482aAyUJ4gRDBuSleA	5	To begin with  this guy is nothing but nice! A genuine soul who goes above and beyond to help and educate. Not at the slightest he made me feel little or unworthy of his time. He didn't rush me to decide nor rush me to leave  he just told me to take my time  think and then decide however i wanted to go with the watches i sold him. He gave me fair price and showed me how the going is out in the market. Im definitely coming back whether to sell or just ask for advice about watches and diamonds. Must go to place for your valuable items!
3vpN2NkgylHLnHtLywF8EA	5	These guys are absolutely amazing.  My 3 series was a mess from not cleaning for a while and having a 6 year old.  They came out on time as promised and took immaculate care detailing and cleaning my car.  A++++ service and experience.  Highly recommend.
kb6Fy2yN6hoMF2BKVoMFUw	5	BEST GELATO EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!  We of coursed Yelped this spot since we didn't wanna spend $10 on a teeny scoop of gelato somewhere along the strip.  This place is located in somewhat of a questionable neighborhood. We originally wanted to get some custard across the street from this spot but that place looked janky and scary so we popped over here and thank God we did too!  The owner literally made us try every single flavor before ordering. She explained to us how she makes her gelato flavors fresh every morning and everything is made with natural ingredients. And I believe it! The banana flavor tasted like you were literally eating a spruced up banana. The most interesting flavor I tried was the dark chocolate with hot peppers (you get the kick of spice right down your throat  soooo cool!) I was literally FULL after trying ALL the flavors so I had to go for a mini scoop of the Avocado gelato. And boy was that delish and totally hit the spot!  If you're craving some homemade gelato THIS is the THE SPOT to hit up while in Vegas. We'll be back here every time we're in this city for sure!
O2TNWgUHaWaUPbKM8EJrDA	5	Me and my girl have been coming here for months now. And we love the 2 girls that do our brow. We may not be able to feel our brows afterwards but they look amazing. LOL. No comment on the older women that works there....
k5qNdi3XThNoy742v5VQFQ	2	Getting a quote from these guys was easy  however I asked for them to email me instead of communicating through yelp  but they called me and said that yelp was how we were going to communicate--...okay...  And then there was confusion regarding them scheduling my appointment for 2 days in a row  opposed to the one day that we had discussed and confirmed.    When they were 30 minutes they called--awesome! It's nice to have a heads-up.    I was getting an area rug and some carpets cleaned but when the guy saw the area rug he said that the stains (just normal wear) were not going to come out.  I knew that it wouldn't look like new--I have cleaned plenty of carpets before in my parent's home with and industrial carpet cleaner.  With my previous knowledge I knew the stains would at least be lightened.  However  after he finished the rug  I was so disappointed in the way it looked (and smelled) that I went out and rented a rug doctor from Ace Hardware.  That lightened the stains DRAMATICALLY and I was extremely disappointed that he didn't try and harder to get the stains out.  Not to mention  it's like having to pay for their mistakes and my stupidity for not making him put more effort into cleaning the rug.    The other carpet that was being cleaned was an industrial black carpet that wasn't stained or anything so it turned out fine.
PhRPOgPxUcNVpBrwDYrjSg	5	Kevin Shroyer recently inspected the condo I am about to buy. He is very personable and one can communicate with him with ease. He is punctual and conducts himself in a professional manner. His inspection report is very detailed and helpful. He goes over every detail and covers everything possibly needed to make a decision. He gave me a small gift after the inspection was over  which was extremely nice of him. Wonderful person and a professional!  I highly recommend his services!
4RzFRd1VUOpDcJXTAI6-Eg	5	I know it seems bias because I work here but I've been waxed by almost all the girls and they're all very professional. I also got my lashes done today by our apprentice Stephanie and she dis a great job! I love my lashes!
ocVa3kcI-Ww2cVB58oLT_g	5	I recommend Farida. I've never got my eyebrows threaded before today she made me feel more confident and less nervous. She understood what I wanted and executed it perfectly.
Fyxc4H2E6warVIbg8ZAdKQ	5	I just moved from California 2 days ago and I couldn't get into my girl before I left so I was in desperate need of a waxing. I researched a few places before I decided on Pink Cherry Wax. The online booking was quick and easy. Being an aesthetician myself  I am a stickler for cleanliness and proficiency. I have always been loyal to the same person in California so I was a bit nervous before my wax due to the circumstance of being in unfamiliar territory. When I walked in  it was cute  clean and inviting. The receptionist was nice. I had my Brazilian done by Kaitlyn. She was sweet   professional  clean  quick and efficient. She made me feel very comfortable and minimal discomfort. I am very happy with my wax and I will be back again. Thank you for a great experience.
5hF7OpL6FoJ4k87qVdD7Sg	5	Unbelievable fresh Mexican. Flavorful and great guys running the place. It's a must go place!
5AylRVDTR6zfMLxlprjXcg	5	Honestly the best carpet cleaning job I've ever had! Rick is so polite and efficient  he did our entire upstairs  on time  did such an amazing job!! He got big stains out that we couldn't and helped us get our money back for our deposit on a rental  no worries at all!...if you need any services go to Carpet Monkeys!! You won't regret it.
4kb2uPIEQt3UN4EhLWXMag	5	As of a few days ago I never knew this amazing place existed!  I found it after searching Google for local lowrider bike parts to finally start rebuilding my '81 Schwinn Stringray.  I met Henry at the door and he gave me some basic info about the place.  I briefly told him about what I wanted to do with my bike and informed me I came to the right place.  He directed me to the owner of the place for additional info.  Later  Henry  showed me all the parts I needed in their massive facility.  He seemed enthusiastic about helping me build my bike which was cool!  The museum area upstairs was occupied by a private event  so I was only able to look from the doorway.  Claims to have the largest collection of bikes and parts  in the country and after a tour of the place you would definitely believe it!  Loved this place and I'll be back often until my bike is finished!
kkEv8k7meXP-xv_DLmGDvg	5	I have seen the Jeff Civillico Comedy in Action Show twice and loved it both times.  Jeff is world class juggler.  He'll juggle just about anything from ping pong balls to bowling balls  knives  and things that are on fire.  He also invents odd tricks that change from show to show  and he completely engages the audience.  In fact  if you sit in front  there is a good chance that you will end up on stage as part of his act.  Little kids have an especially good time on stage.  The show takes place in the afternoon  so it's meant for families and people who want to skip sexually suggestive shows.  The theater is a little bit tough to find since The Quad is under renovation  but it's totally worth the extra effort.
CTTR35cKWy_BxsT6BTd55Q	5	David was the only one to personally respond to my 4 request for a quote  and inspection. The others only sent emails. David showed up and did a complete walkthrough inspection. He spent the time to explain the treatment  and the various pricing offers. His prices were very fair  and his service did what they said the would. The 5 year warranty is a good deal.
OkP-St4QePQlK2RpPvMp2A	5	I used to live in the burg and didn't realize there is such a quirky museum in the city. Moved away 17 years ago and started biking again. Read about this on an online magazine and now have reason to go back to Pittsburgh and visit. This definitely was a surprise- hundreds of bikes from decades old and from my childhood to more recent concepts. Interesting bikes were the ones used by Pewee Herman and some original ones used in movies by Nick Cage and Russel Crowe. It also has tons memorabilias from the past that will take you to a trip down memory lane . This place have everything for everyone from kids to grandpas. Should be included in everyone's must visit when in Pittsburgh.
8U7mzjP5381klyYSzNqveg	5	This company is awesome! Called back and got my appointment scheduled within a few days and honored a coupon price I had found. They came early and have great prices. Our sectional looks brand new. The owner was super friendly  helpful and honest. Highly recommend!
X8YWi6qteCyTYeLow9hFgw	5	I have been going to Max Automotive for awhile now  and cannot express enough how very happy I am with their work!!  It is a family owned business  and have very honest mechanics!  Kathy at the front desk is such a sweetie pie  both on the phone and in person! Terry has always been honest and fair when it comes to repairs and pricing!! Jenny is my  chauffeur  to and from home if I need to leave my car at the shop  and she has an amazing personality!! Of course  I cannot forget to mention Max and Sophie!! You will find these precious fur babies at the front door  waiting to greet you! I HIGHLY recommend Max Automotive to anyone who needs a mechanic!!
avxpRQ84Y4LWqbPOQiMOHQ	5	First time and service was extraordinary  they took me in right away and the staff is very pleasant. Will come back
8WPxs3On-yiAP3hZfEqoDQ	5	Everyone at noble cleaners is extremely helpful and they do a great job.  I use them at my home and recommend them to everyone who asks.
c1LuiBuq2EtkIdotT-rGnw	5	This is the only place where I'm a regular. The tacos are amazing  the staff is always nice and friendly  and it's ridiculously cheap for the quality of food you're getting.  Would absolutely recommend to anyone who is looking for good tacos. I have brought over 10 people here and will continue to bring more. 10/10
XqLuBTW0oSpv07PvMqXgOQ	1	After seeing these negative reviews splurged all over this page like a raw sewage leak  I figured we'd pour a little more gas on the fire. I mean it really is just one after another and I can attest every nightmare on this page is the real deal Holyfield ladies and gents. Let me throw a few numbers out here:  0 - the amount of answers the customer service dept will be able to provide you as you wonder if you will ever see your possessions again.   0 - % chance the movers will show up during the time frame they say the will  you're honestly a lucky SOB if they show up on the day they give you.    1 - lawsuit filed.   1 - half ass apology from the BBB saying they unfortunately can't do anything to prevent this business from ripping you off. The BBB doesn't recommend this company... well bite my balls and call me Skippy  who would've ever thought that? I really thought Lavar Ball was a man of the people??  3 - packs of cigarettes smoked a day by the woman who gave me this grand slam of a deal.  9 - # of employees cursed at over the phone. I felt a little remorseful about this initially  but I have theory that they have a weekly office pool where the objective is to bait customers into having a meltdown or aneurysm  whichever happens first. However  since these wagers take place at headquarters in Vegas they're actually operating within the law. (Disclaimer: if you struggle with gambling addiction  put your mortgage on Freddy Couples to lead Master's after the first day. If that doesn't hit  double down & put your most valuable family possession on Izzo and the Michigan State Spartan's to go all the way in March Madness. IF you're STILL in the hole after those two LOCKS  go all in and put your 1st born kid on the one horse at the Kentucky Derby who's as grey as the Nantucket mist. Whatever you do  don't be a quitter and seek help).  21 - number of minutes I engaged in a verbal argument with the moving guy about how many stairs were on the one flight between the 2nd and ground floor of my apt building. Probably the most flustered I've ever been in my life  but that's exactly what happens when you charge $5 a stair. It was like dealing with the kid in elementary school who makes up his own rules no matter what game you're playing and just expects you to follow them. Whether you're playing  count the stairs  or  chutes & ladders   this guy and that kid are both insufferable assholes.  30 - # of business days you're shipment is GUARANTEED to arrive within. LOLOLOLOLOLOL.    32 - # of voicemails Angelo purposefully keeps in his voice box to ensure it stays full and he doesn't have to deal with you. Let me tell you  ole Angelo is a magician  and not one those who does card tricks. I'm talking about one of those professional Magi's who can disappear into thin air. I thought the guy must've gotten placed in witness protection or something  because I'm fairly certain I could've found D.B. Cooper before Angelo. And for the record  I think there's a solid chance Angelo's name is an alias. You can't just disappear with that vibrant of a name  I'd guess his real name is George or something super dull. Kinda like how Enrique Iglesias name translates to Henry Churches. When you connect the dots it just makes too much sense.   42 - the only jersey # retired in every MLB stadium (I'm watching playoff baseball while I type this)  69 - nice  85 - amount I had to pay for an elevator fee after we couldn't come to an agreement on how many damn stairs there were. (Moving Guy was too big of a coward to go best 2 out of 3 against me in rock  paper  scissors).  94 - % chance something will be missing  broken  or both when your shipment finally does arrive. Luckily for me the only thing they misplaced was a small end table that I REALLY fudged up a paint job on. The thing was hideous & if I had to bet it's smack dab in the middle of asshole who can't count stairs living room. Jokes on you buddy  that end table was ugly as sin and throws off the color of the whole room. Your interior decorating game is weak sauce you BUM. Chalk up a win for the good guys.  104 - # of exact days it took to receive my shipment. Yet somehow those two degenerate Englishmen made it around the world in 80 days and that was in 1956!.   400 - dollars I owe in lawyer fees to now drop the aforementioned lawsuit.   -also my PR on the squat.... Yeah that was a lie  I treat leg day like it's Ebola.  In conclusion  dealing with these people turned out to be one wild ass ride. So welcome to the big leagues future customers  you're about to be f****d hard body karate.   **Editor's Note**   It'd sure be nice to get all of my fellow disgruntled customers/victims together for a BBQ or something. I'll bring a couple of gallons of Milo's sweet tea and a corn-hole set. If anyone has a good banana pudding recipe toss this post a like. Until then  best of luck to you and yours.    We're going to hell so bring your sunblock                     -Ari Gold
LIL0BSxE4STx4DZCEClYTw	5	I wanted a security system installed as soon as my house closed on 12/15/15 and JPG was able to deliver.  Jim was so knowledgeable and polite!  He had an installation done within 1-2 days and I couldn't be happier  The keypad is easy to use and my 10-year old said he felt safer -- that's what it's all about!  Thank you  Jim!  I highly recommend JPG!
BDSLLE-zeah4HV50YTfPIA	5	Amazing! Everything we have sampled and ordered has been absolutely delicious. Great costumer service and family friendly atmosphere. Our kids love it here  they can have dessert and play/color. I personally love that they have different variations of a flavor  as one batch sells out  another similar but not exact creation is introduced.
WzUVRbz8ugsUOyul6LlbNg	5	I'm from Houston  Tx and I've had some problems finding places that have good Mexican food  but this place OHHH MYYY GOOODDD!!! It had to be so far the best one I've had. My first best one just made second to this place. Damn good prices and amazing customer service.
p7mwIcNkhqc-2p0ePbct6g	1	Out of the blue  yesterday I get a USPS letter from  OnTrac  of Phoenix.  This letter informs me that my  Signature on File record with OnTrac  has expired and drivers can no longer leave packages at my door without my signature.  I've never heard of this company.  Reading the reviews below  evidently Amazon uses them for delivery  and I have bought items at Amazon.    Did they deliver a package at some time in the past?  I don't know.  Did I ever previously authorize them to keep my signature on record?  NO.  Do I want them to have my signature on file?  Absolutely not.  Amazon choses them to deliver  Amazon is responsible for their actions - such as providing them my name  address  etc.  Perhaps a good reason to avoid Amazon as well?  Not even a SASE in the OnTrac mailing - I'm supposed to send them their info at my expense.  Not gonna do that.
Xdv9aV3hUNwv3oiCDuLbMw	5	As a first time waxer  I was extremely nervous going into my appointment with Shaina. However  she made me feel so comfortable and she is so skilled in her trade. I was extremely pleased with the results. Shaina truly is a Master Aesthetician. I highly recommend Shaina and her staff at Pink Cherry to anybody looking to get waxed.
GMeaJSlRbK6xfLbYnO69Aw	5	Sometimes I have the rare pleasure of being in town for business. On the road  sometimes I need my Mexican hot sauce. These sauces are hot and flavorful  the tortilla chips are always fresh. They have some kind of Mexican Cole slaw that's just epic  especially topped with their red salsa ... Kiss Papa now  seriously Kiss Papa ...  Price = 11/10 Food quality=10/10  Cleanliness is next to Godliness = 10/10
xPKQDWx2NmNlxoCsBrJA4w	1	Landlord would not allow satellite dishes so I had no choice but to use cable. The video quality was not as good as satellite  but this was a short-term move so I figured I could live with it. The picture quality continued to degrade and pixellates constantly. I finally called last month when the pixellation got much worse and the picture kept freezing and skipping  (audio not affected). I was told that they were working in the area and the problem was temporary. I explained that the problem had been there for at least 2 weeks  but the tech support refused to help me  just kept saying that it would get better. It didn't get better  sometimes it was even worse  the middle of the screen had a pink section and the edges would be in B&W. I am moving soon so I just kinda lived with it. So I called today to cancel service  you can't do it online  you HAVE to call customer  support . Spent 30 minutes on hold  the process wasn't too bad once they finally answered the phone  except that I have to deliver the equipment to a Cox store. Direct TV sends pre-paid shipping boxes  I guess they care about their customers. Wish I could have given them 0 or negative stars  COX really sucks on internet speed  picture quality  and customer service. If you can  go satellite!
gXwrt2l00zzOWEeJgJYJkg	5	Do yourself a favor and just call Eric and his team! As a REALTor®  I appreciated the excellent customer service and fair and upfront pricing. I will use SuperJunk again in the future for any of my real estate needs and when referring a junk removal company to clients.
DSDn3Hnt8JTni4YefvsjWw	5	Absolutely a professional  knowledgeable  and conscientious company.  Wonderful customer service  Jim was everything fellow Yelpers described.  The installation was seamless and the installer knowledgeable.  The technology was exactly what we were looking for our home and is what we had hoped for in an alarm system.  I would recommend the company to anyone looking for a home alarm
rp6l-5Nnt4-bzAsYnnOfVw	5	Carpets look brand new! I love HydroClean! Staff was very professional  quick  and they pulled out about 4 buckets of dirt! Thank you guys!
1c9SipOYstwWba26B4B1cw	5	I had John the owner here. He did a speedy and excellent job. Very well mannered. I would use them again.
ND7XRzKGoHA6KNJnmlkx-w	1	www.FTC.com  Make complaint. The more complaint they get  They will change up their policy. Please as a community we should do something about it. Verizon offer double the speed and the same price as cox cable. Make a complaint that we should be able to pick more then one isp  not One or 2 isp in a single monopoly money making scheme.
XVAyXEuu3dQVxe9-KcQupw	5	LOVE this store location! We have been here multiple times for various items and every interaction we've had with Josh and Anjoly has been amazing! They are so knowledgeable and helpful and are truly passionate about helping you make the best choice possible to have a great night's sleep for years to come! We highly recommend purchasing mattresses  box springs  and accessories from them!
lctc4QJUTk6e6UsLI6KUww	5	Best guy To go to for all screen repairs. Took less than a half hour and did a great job. Would recommend to anyone 10/10
VJXK6URYMcnT5o4Vuka86g	5	Fixed 3 phones for me quickly.   Two screens and one battery  guy was informative and tried his best to be nice.   Owner builds internet tv boxes that you can watch anything on  also offers lifetime replacement program. Has several options including gaming box.   Would come here again to get phones repaired at good price.
YLGd8cp2lOiAWWJOxZRWMg	5	I have to say that I am so super impressed with my recent mattress buying experience. My husband and I were really worried about buying the right mattress and not really having any knowledge about mattress shopping. Joshua was absolutely amazing and so helpful that instead of shopping around  we purchased out mattress right there and then. Let me tell you that my husband and I are so incredibly happy we made our purchase with Joshua and really appreciate how friendly and knowledgeable he was. He answered all of our questions and he thoroughly explained the 120 day policy for exchanging our mattress if we purchased one that was not right for us. As a consumer  you could not ask for better service than we received and his expertise made my husband and I feel so at ease about our buying decision. I am recommending everyone I know to go and see him. If we ever need another mattress  we know who we are going to see!
GPyNvrwxjaso5bjyw7PbKA	3	The gelato was good  not great. The owner however was awesome. She explained all the flavors and that each is made fresh daily.    She just kept giving me samples to try. I'd go back just to give her my business. You could tell she's very passionate about her gelato. Her prices are very fair.
hAQTo2Dmo0fELWQPTNTloA	5	Discovering those little termite trails is never a good thing.  This company made everything so very easy.  Excellent service.  Prompt and delightful team.  Fair price.  Highly recommend.
I0KKCEDU1dqQM4GwjzFuKw	5	Omar was able to take an appointment on short notice  Clean waiting room  great service and quality work. Window tint came out great. They took the time to get the job done right the first time. He explained the procedure and what to expect. I highly recommend Omar's window tinting for anyone with window tint needs  especially in the AZ Heat / Sun.
3Il1he_LY9rRTTlKij_48Q	5	Very reliable   professional and efficient. Replies quickly and was here when he said he would be! And a great job a cleaning carpets too! I will definitely use them again and I highly recommend them!
5Z6u8bH8kmXcw1kcObx6bQ	5	Aaron is very knowledgeable he knows what he's talking about and he won't swindle you.  He will be honest with you and will guide you in the right direction with the jewelry you are trying to get rid of.
VuXCQgqCqBEsNezyyhXX_w	5	Amazing. It is so delicious. Very natural and you can try the different flavours first. Very nice and friendly staff. Greets from germany
ueCQOhBTbe0zOx9e70OG9w	5	I wanted to try out a new carpet cleaning company after I grew disappointed with some aspects of the previous company who i had used for over 2 yrs so after reading many of the 5 star reviews on Yelp I went with fresh start carpet cleaners....they showed up on time for our appointment and the service I requested was very reasonably priced.....my carpet is old and needs replacing so my expectations of the results weren't high but despite how old it is after their service I was very impressed by how good they got it too look!!! I would highly recommend them!!
9m0WjffMaZhXn2z3zo7I6Q	5	I have never really trusted auto shops as I feel they are always out to get you when your car is not working right.    I was so impressed with Max Automotive from the beginning to end of their service.  Not only did they help with rides to and from work but they actually saved me money from their original estimate.  Not only do they do great work but they are very honest.  This is hard to come by in the auto repair world.  They also fixed my parents car for $300 less than others shops were going to fix it for.  If you have anything that needs work  i would highly recommend Max Automotive!!!
bL1ZnlNdOTuli5lRjOMqqQ	5	Just bought a house with a water purification system installed.  I'm so glad Colburn puts their phone number on their equipment so we didn't have to go searching for it. I called to schedule a service appointment  got an appointment right away. The gentleman who came out was right on time  very friendly and informative.  He made sure all my questions were answered as well as getting the service history on my system for me so he wasn't trying to charge me for services or parts not needed. Thank you!!!!  As a new client to their business  they have definitely earned my business for the system maintenance along with any plumbing issues I might run into in the future.
y2ldzWz6OXO2nKdMYNUJ0Q	5	WOW!  We have a fairly new dryer but recently the clothes had been taking forever to dry (hours for a load of towels).  I was sure it was the dryer itself but realized that i may be the vent after checking some online blogs.  So I decided to risk the $69 to have Matt check it out...money well spent.  He was at my house for FIVE hours and did not charge me any additional fees.  That's impressive!!  And even more impressive...my dryer works better than it ever has before and my towels dry in minutes!!  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
WEjI9WuCM4Nddok1RTye3A	5	Best Taco Shop in Arizona  everything is made from scratch everything is so fresh from there veggies to there salsas to there chicken everything is full of flavor super authentic tacos!! And on top of that they're very cheap it's a bang for your buck!!! I REALLY RECOMMEND THEM great costumer service also!
6hbWUk3VlxJd8jJNrR9mFA	5	On time and Gene was super friendly and easy to work with. Our tile looked old and ready to be replaced until Noble came and made it looks new again. Grout looked brand new. Seriously  we have tried Zerorez and the others. These guys are the best.
m-ipwCf2b18f-S1dDZHjMg	1	Horrible horrible shipping service. Ordered three textbooks from amazon  free shipping for two of them and one required the normal shipping price. Was expecting to have them shipped through Fedex or UPS  and was surprised to see Ontrac  which I had never heard of.  I begin school out of town next week and the textbooks were pricey  and I still have not received them.  Ontrac tracking says that it was delivered this afternoon to my front door.....weird because there is nothing on my porch and I never heard a knock or the doorbell. None of my neighbors have received it either.  I emailed their customer service and received a relatively quick reply  however she just explained that my issue would be sent to the more local Ontrac representative and they would get back to me. I just want my textbooks! Who knows where they are.
__hI00d8ER7rhbR0rNQoAw	5	I chose this place based solely on yelp reviews. They absolutely live up to each one of those 5 stars! Everything was painless  from making the appointment on the phone  all the way to payment. Even Mr. Kitty's 2 shots seems painless! The staff here is incredibly friendly  and ever so patient with scared animals. My questions were answered and we got treatment in office  and were able to walk out the door with the rest! This is the first time I've personally taken my cat to the Vet and I was very pleased with out experience. I will most definitely be counting on Hayden Road Animal Hospital to care for my little fur baby!
bsIevVX9b90BP0DfOPBdwA	5	Kevin Shroyer was Great!!! He did such a thorough job on our home inspection  he explained every detail with us and took his time answering all our questions. I highly recommend him to anybody that's looking for a home inspector!!!!
5JZl5w3R8IDIz0xxMm66DA	5	Best ice cream ever. This place rocks. This is a must visit shop for anyone with a sweet tooth or craving ice cream. You have to come here. You won't be disappointed.
2cj3CuOHg0Rvu_-vCmvl0g	5	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!! I have been here 3times(I'm accident prone). Mike and Mark are awesome. Their estimate beat the other shops. They kept me informed and kept their word on when things would be done. Customer service is top notch. I also appreciate the detail when all work is done. I live in Aliante and I drive all the way to them. Thanks guys!!!
gd0Qg3V-bTQBdzusfGpDzQ	5	Delicious gelato  generous portions  awesome owner. When you arrive  the flavors are explained to you and multiple samples offered. The owner really cares that you have a great experience. I've never been approached this way at any other dining experience  so this is why I'm writing my very first review on yelp. There are so many unique flavors. Definitely a work of art.
5giVkZxW2tN440UlSvADYQ	5	Best carpet cleaning service I have had. Company made carpets look brand new. Removed spots that have been there since we moved in and that other cleaning companies could not remove. Cleaned like it was his own home.
m50zQ9OxpeSx9ebpZZZQHQ	5	In town for spring break and needed a wax before going to the pool.  Kaitlyn did an amazing job - especially since it'd been awhile.  She was great to talk to - took my mind off of things. She was very thorough  gave me tips for after-care. Receptionist was very friendly.  The salon is very well-decorated -love the pin ups on the wall  cute seating area. Clean  friendly  great price. Will be back!
Tvp_l41KqDq-I2Tq7q_cuA	5	I have been coming here consistently for my lashes and have been very pleased with the product and price. My real Lashes go to slow so I can get a bill every 3 weeks  again the place is adorable. Manager acknowledged my problem with Brazilian and she offered I come in so I'm not left with bad taste in mouth. She did an AMAZING JOB! FAST and The most close to a totally painless Brazilian. She corrected the problem When we first discussed the issues I had and appreciated my feed back. I was very impressed and appreciated that she takes her business Feed back and clients serious
YuRKPRTGd1GgFJsOyuOJZQ	5	10+ stars! Peter was competent  courteous  professional  great detailing work at fair pricing. Mason his assistant was also as good. You can't go wrong. The best! Will avail of their services more in the future. Spectacular product of their work. Good enough to be entered in a concours d'elegance show. Sterling best practices utilized in customer service. Eager to educate their clients about how to take care of your vehicle. Kudos to both of you. Thanks again  Peter.
jBEDwRusmqDkXZnvMO3Uuw	5	Let me start off by saying Charles is the Best!!I have done Botox in Newport Beach but was never as happy with the results as with Charles. He puts you at ease and is extremely knowledgeable where to do the injections. I brought many of my family to him and all were happy. Sadly I am returning to NB but decided to fly in every 2-3 mos to see him to keep up with vanity
l3PPJFisYtE4YKrbpPCLfg	5	What is not to love about this place?!! It's a cute little centered place that simply serves gelato and espresso. One of the two greatest things in life. Not just any gelato  because this is simply the best  most flavorful  innovative flavors  and creamiest gelatos that i've tried. Art of Flavors is all in the name and they truly practice what they preach--the art of combining flavors into a delicious creamy treat.   What I love most about this place is how they combine unheard of flavors and even savory flavors such as corn  foie gras  sweet potato & caramel  bean  rosemary & EVOO all the way to Cabernet Sauvignon  avocado  parmesan & black pepper  to fruit loops. They have it all. They simply construct these flavors oh so well  that you'll want to be coming back for more each time. The best part is that they can package any flavor for you to go so you can stash some at home.     This place must not go unnoticed. This place is a must for any local and tourist alike. Sit back  relax  and enjoy some gelato.
q41O5MeErCakttYXy8xlhw	5	This is really a great place. I won't bring my car anywhere else. I've owned my current vehicle for 2 years and have only brought it here. Whenever I need repairs it's super easy and my car is in and out. Recently I brought my car in for an overheating issue  turned out it wasn't as big of an issue as I originally thought. Steve called me and had a 12 minute conversation about the issue and then when I picked up my car we had another conversation making sure I had complete understanding. I've been to places that completely dismiss you when you have questions and I seriously appreciated that. Would definitely recommend these guys!
57_RxVY9z11Xk8h1jlNc6w	5	Excellent  fast customer service! I went to another store and was quoted a much higher price and then came here to get my iPhone 6 repaired at a fraction of the price and in less than 10 min. Will definitely come back in the future for any issues.
vIpr8Ss80BNRSRRD42pw0w	1	Terriable company shady warranty sold me a 5000$ bed and within 30 days I needed to make an exchange for the longer king and the 90 day guarantee is riddled with loop holes
0tzLpLZjfGU9CX50pEmsmw	3	Paid for the yelp coupon to have someone tell me that I needed a new water softener.  Glad that didn't cost me the normal $80.  The service person was ok.  He was nice but like I said  it wasn't worth the cost.
BSl7qfuKUhQNTbWsbc1mJw	5	Shay is my new favorite person.   Finding a hairdresser is one of the most stressful things for me. My hair grows slowly and one bad cut could last for years. I emailed the salon with my concerns and had a response and an appointment booked within 5 minutes.   Jump to the day of....  Shay is so talented! She gave me the haircut I have wanted for years and I could not be happier. I cannot wait to go back and maybe add some fun color to the mix!
1HJ7QwIy4wLmHUyypEDSxQ	5	Aaron was an absolute pleasure to work with. Not only is he honest and very knowledgeable in his craft  but was very patient and thorough in the entire process of evaluating my jewelry on it's value  and gave me a fair price. I would absolutely deal with him again. Anyone looking to sell their jewelry or gold  Aaron is the MAN to go to!! I give 10 1/2 stars if yelp would allow it!!!!
Lqc53P_ejkMb6U2kyCsaGw	5	My carpets were in dire straits and I wasn't happy with the last company I'd used. I checked yelp and went with Carpet Monkeys. I'm SO glad I did! I called  Rick scheduled around my timing  I even changed days at the last minute  and he showed up as planned. He is amazing! Professional  on time  hard working  and easy to get along with. I am so happy with my carpets! And  if you're looking for fair and competitive prices  this is your man! You can not do better than Carpet Monkeys!
miDfR25oYIKRPcw95CtPpw	5	Sooooo beyond good and crazy location in a very residential area. It is worth going off the beaten path. No booze or chips--but the tacos are unreal!
xdox_Dxb4Oeyp57evbx_rw	1	Cox Cable is the definition of a monopoly for wired cable and internet if you are located in their territory.  Their entire operation is terrible from customer service to the actual cable/internet itself.  Unfortunately there is no other option  so I am stuck with these monkeys
gE2yi38uxyXCuOoAPHaA-g	5	Awesome awesome awesome.   Couldn't be happier with results.  Very professional and efficient.   I had high traffic areas and now I'm ready for the fall and winter season.   Overall it was a good job.
wGS1poIb37DmyqnuXTPnQQ	1	You people make me sick.  It's not bad enough you over charge your customers but you think for that money we could get a little customer service.  To get your service in my home I have to pay $75 to have a tech come out and make my living room an ugly mess.  Instead of showing a little effort and setting up an outlet like I requested I came back to find a cable wire ran from the outside wall  over a door way and on top of the carpet.  Pathetic service.  Being a loyal customer of yours get you nothing.  My bill is over $200 every month for only cable and internet and I routinely purchase ppv events.  When I ordered the latest UFC fight and invited 20 something people over to my house to watch it your feed froze and we were forced to leave to watch the fights in a bar.  When I called on Saturday you can't even provide service to let us know if it will come back on and have a message to call back later.  Pathetic.  When I called on Monday to ask for a credit I was told you would only issue a $10 credit. You must hire comedians to do your customer service cause that has to be a joke.  I shouldn't even have to make the call to ask for this. IT SHOULD BE CREDITED IN FULL WITHOUT QUESTION.  I can't think of a more poorly ran business.    The only reason you aren't out of business is because you have a monopoly because your customer service is worthless.
SXPWLKdSR7CeWyToZDNR9A	5	On March 13th I got my engine mounts done by Crawfords. This was my first time trying out this new shop. The one I usually go to is over priced for the work they do. I had called around for shop pricing and these guys gave very good estimate and I would save over $500! The engine mounts I had installed were OEM and the original estimate said I would need 3 and a possible alignment but that was a mistake and later was changed to 4 mounts and a lower estimate provided. Brad called me once my car was finished and told me it actually no alignment was needed. The total came out to under the original estimated amount! Fantastic work! My car no longer shakes and vibrates like a massage chair anymore! This place is very competitive in prices so call Crawford's Auto Repair first!
AvcLgf7mx_IXxIzhUOKY4Q	5	Seriously.....Seriously!!  Jeff is HILARIOUS!  I love this show!  If Jim Carey as Ace Ventura made a baby with a seriously hot man  Jim would pop out!   Great for kids  great for adults that want to have a fun time.  He juggles mostly  but does some crowd interactions  more juggling and spontaneous improv.  Go!
VEhzcMcB53CWsDA51Znatg	5	I checked out a few places before finding Affordable Flooring & More but glad that I went down and personally spoke to them.  They were completely professional  offered great advice for what I needed (with me having two dogs) and understood my price point.  They aren't pushy salesmen and were very easy to work with.  On top of that  his installation crew was quick/efficient and asked me questions on what I would prefer on the install.  Overall great experience and I'll be choosing them again for my next project!
1Fl33goEm3ohZPKrDAEa3Q	5	I have been coming here for about a year to get my brows waxed  and this place is seriously awesome. The staff is all super friendly  and they do a wonderful job. I normally see master artist Whitney  but she is out for a while  so today I saw their apprentice Shomari. She really did a wonderful job  doing exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend!!
S9Uhw2yChU-0SbAmDZdJsg	5	Josh was very helpful and knowledgeable with all the different mattresses I was looking at. I've had this bed for over a month now and I've never slept better!!
I45CM4Tv3L0N91p562APRA	1	Cox  the worst internet service and the worst customer service ever ever ever ever ever! I do not want to give them one star   zero is more appropriate. I hope they realize if they're going to keep customers they need to greatly improve their customer service. I hope we can all find a better internet provider out there! They obviously need more competition and perhaps that would make them treat their customers better!
jVLqZGNDNH6y-e4HO6judg	5	Matt is great  he did a great job of explaining everything he was doing.I will recommend him to everyone in our development.
rgJFlxgd3y84V5BrTkxbxA	5	Hired Kevin based on the reviews on Yelp. He is worth every penny he charges and he's an extremely nice guy. Very professional  zero nonsense  highly knowledgeable. Inspection happened early on a Sunday  got the report before 1PM. I was there for most of the inspection. At the end  he does a very thorough presentation of his findings while displaying the photos he took during the inspection. Cancelled the purchase and saved myself a ton of $$$ and grief. Will hire him for the next inspection.
T09uv2Xs8n1yjmf1CXAdcg	5	I am writing this review so people will know of the great service of this shop  not to set the expectation that you should get something for nothing.  If you need work done on your car  the service here goes above and beyond.  I stopped into Mitch's at 4:30 on a Friday afternoon as I was driving back to the East Valley from North Scottsdale.  I was driving just a couple miles up the road and suddenly the oil pressure gauge in my truck spiked to high  So I pulled in just to ask an opinion on if they thought I could get the truck back to the East Valley or should I park it and call for a ride.  Based on the information I gave them  the guy I was speaking to said that he was fairly certain it was a small issue (oil pressure sending unit) and that the truck would be fine to drive.  That was enough for me  but as I turned to leave he offered to come check the oil before I left.  Everything checked out  and as I turn to leave I asked him his name so I could thank him  and he simply replied  Mitch.   Thanks Mitch for the peace of mind for our family.
rWPSMfNKAflDFhaLWMwFUw	5	The whole process was completely painless. I got a quote 20 minutes after requesting it. The prices were reasonable. They were kind enough to text our tenant to let them know they were on the way. Before and after photos were taken  we also received an invoice which was exactly what we needed for our accounting. They have a very professional  efficient and organized business I highly recommend them.
3mb-1Bi7Smx-eR05lhZ8Ag	1	Not sure why I switched cable companies.  Totally disappointed so far!  TV delays while changing the channels  extra hidden costs  additional one time fees never disclosed.  Free for a year-NO charged $15.99 for HBO.  They installed a modem!  A modern?  Who used that anymore.  Called switched it out the next day  now I have an additional $7.00 fee.  Not recommending it at all.  I will be contacting customer service on Tuesday.
1fNbFbAs0_z4w7ClJbGQHQ	5	I've never had carpeting until I moved into this house and they were in rough shape! They were stained a SMELLY! I requested a quote on yelp  and they responded in less than an hour  and were very well priced. They came the very next day and did a great job. Patrick checked for spots and was very considerate and explained everything he was doing. They smell so much better now!! I would recommend HydroCare and (if my carpets survive) will use them again.
ANbL2ZZtwnaynmy6OjHHJw	4	Great prices. We were able to get the deal we wanted with next day delivery. The sales person was a little pushy...but in the long run I'm happy with our purchase. Only possible negative with our experience is that the delivery guys accidentally tore off the warranty tags on our mattress. Otherwise  they were very nice and quick with setup.
gjK9RcHcaACteAnOdOfi5g	5	I scheduled an oil change for 1:30PM  but showed up early...no problem at all  I was put in 30 minutes. Very good customer service  and you can tell they like what they do.
278SMz3lOQFmpDOiSCvd7Q	5	Called around and found this to be the best price I could find. The owner took the time to explain my options when I got there and wasn't pushy at all. When I finally chose decided which I wanted to go with he said it would be about 1.5 hours. To my surprise he came back in a little over and hour and said it was done. The tint looked great without having to spend too much money.
vN1MbGY32Ldx08OubqFneg	5	I went to Pink Cherry for the first time today and had a waxing appointment with Shomari. She was FANTASTIC!! The girls are the front are super sweet and everyone was very understanding when I was a few minutes late for my appointment due to traffic. The appointment went so smoothly and I was so comfortable thanks to Shomari! The salon is adorable and clean and they use the best products! I will definitely be back!
wih7sMTxaY17lXDDJv1irg	5	Great experience! Farida is very sweet and calming. My eyebrows came out great! I've had some negative experiences with threading before but she did such a good job. She recognized that I was a student and even offered me the student discount! I feel comfortable highly recommending her to anyone and everyone looking for affordable quality eyebrow therapy:)
wVJma20bH29gJzLQVM3dWQ	5	This company answered the call.  We had called 6 other plumbers prior to looking on Yelp.  He was our first call and he answered the phone!!!! And was able to come over same day  and fixed the problem.  I have to say quick response  knowledgeable and will recommend.  We knew all up front cost  before he came out.  And his prices are fair.  Our issue was fixed quickly.  Thank you Rich!  We will be recommending you to our family and friends!
ubVNLR9vCQgV1wmSTKefuA	5	There were 10 people waiting for Farida  but one of the other ladies (a very tiny  very quiet lady - sorry  didn't catch your name!) was available so I didn't have to wait at all despite walking in. She did the most amazing job I have ever had on my eyebrows after about ten solid years of getting them threaded. She was so careful and meticulous and made them more perfect than I could imagine. I am not local  so I took a picture so I can show it everywhere else I go to get threaded from now on as a gold standard of eyebrow perfection. This lady deserves a waiting list  but I got really really lucky today.
VNFShZ9YXo5BOUQN_590pw	5	Great job following through on what was promised!  Jim responded late at night to some concerns we had and helped us get everything figured out.  Great company to work with!
cWgd1C-KxEntbena5IqkXA	1	If I could give no stars that would be more accurate.  These guys are horrible liars.  No the addiess is not wrong  no you didn't even try to find the house  no it can't possibly be sitting in a drivers truck at his home.  Are they kidding? My package is in his truck? In his truck for three days?  In his driveway? Not in a secure facility?   Then they lied about trying to deliver it on Saturday.  When Amazon was on the phone they were apologizing and making arrangements to deliver it the next day on Saturday but by 9AM they say they tried to deliver it and could not find the house.  But the man told Amazon that he printed out a map to deliver it.  LIARS. Why does Amazon even use these people??? You expect more from Amazon. I should not have to even speak to a Ontrac person  I did not hire them....Amazon did. I complained to Amazon and the sent a replacement package overnight UPS....if everyone did this maybe Amazon would stop using shady companies that lie to everyone.
C5Ta3oohbN2ycxCEdYIV1Q	5	If you're looking for an honest  hard working  affordable and reliable carpet and grout service than Rick is your man! Rick always goes out of his way to provide helpful hints that will save you money in the future and preserve your carpet and you never have to worry about draining your wallet but you will get great service and beautiful carpets.  There aren't many business in Vegas that can say that!  Please call Rick  you won't regret it.
713ktc5jHBQT16J2rRPrrQ	5	Rich replaced the piping in my shower quickly and for a fair price. He was very prompt and courteous. Will be calling him back for all plumbing needs.
qURC02E-YJr9oM62i2kWNg	5	Wow. Came here because of the glowing reviews and I was not dissapointed. The food was amazing. The quesadilla was maybe the best I've ever had. The beans it came with were authentic and awesome. I also tried the tacos which were good plain but with their pico and salsa were wonderful. Definitely will come back. The restaurant  is not much to look at and in a challenged area but definitely worth a tasty visit.
NoHlQ7bUJl5u8V6uQwWL_w	1	Absolutely HorRIBLE service.  Deliveries do not arrive as scheduled.  Calls to the company are a waste of time.  I sent an email and got an automated response that said  customer service will contact you within 24 hrs . That was a week ago; no call.  I did complain to Amazon. I would suggest that all of you do the same.
BniJ3Hu-sOXmlAx3Efz85Q	5	Shopped some jewelry around that I was looking to sell. I found lv jewelry exchange and decided to make a stop. Decided to sell my jewelry they were honest and fair. If you are looking for somewhere in Vegas to sell your jewelry you should check them out.
7icwhZpzdrWqPLQbHF2tBA	5	I've been in Vegas for just about a year now and have tried waxing and threading all across the city. Pink Cherry is a hidden gem. It was by far the cleanest  accurate  and best waxing in Vegas! Could not have asked for more beginning with the polite and informative ladies at the front desk  amazing waxing  to the courtesy follow up call.   Thank you to all the staff at Pink Cherry! Hope to continue to enjoy your services for years to come!
TumPWcrwCpIkZqJ0fYpJ_Q	4	Very pleasantly surprised. Everything is pure b nice. Dishes in the ratio of price and quality are ideal. The waitress quickly oriented and gave advice.
fzvw0CJ4zeGFDsDRNk38TA	5	They did a FABULOUS job. I called this morning and they got me in today. They were also right in the time frame they gave me. They told me between 12 and 2 and he came at 1:15. I had a corner that needed cleaning due to puppy accidents and they made it worth my money and did my stairs  entire loft  and office too. Very friendly and very quick. I'm going to use them to clean my tile and grout next.
fU2HYA7ImfS_-eul1lJ_6A	5	Would absolutely recommend.  I used them for a job as my regular plumbing contact was out of town  and ended up using them for 2 subsequent jobs the following week.  Prompt and professional service  and Jason was extremely courteous and responsive.  Great family run business that I will be using both for my home and rental property going forward
gKTr4KaetaFxwzroqtwhyQ	5	Best tacos! I highly recommend trying the main 4. They will all hit the spot. Would definitely go back
MBTB9qktZuvwU7hDa2gSlA	5	UPDATE REVIEW 06/19/18  (still deserves a 5-star!)  Patrick gave me a call the next day after I wrote my initial review  regarding the engine splash guard issue I mentioned. He invited me back to the shop so they can take a look at it.   2-3 months later (today)  I finally made the time to stop by (as the sound of the guard dragging the road was really starting to bug me). The receptionist recognized me! :D the manager on duty (I apologize I did not catch his name) went ahead and took care of the issue right away. No hassle. It only took 10-15 mins for them to fix it too.   I highly recommend this place  if you're looking for a collision shop.
qCmywW1G2Kof-SkkgxVsYg	5	This place is adorable and the ice cream is amazing. They have a wide range of flavors and the ice cream is homemade and tastes fresh! We love going here for a family treat. They'll give you a sample of a flavor  just ask!
OeBnq1GWVaQ4vxTlvXxP8Q	5	Amazing dessert place for all ages. Chef Desyree  has the best skills to blend most unique flavors into the tastiest gelatos. Some of the most unique flavor that I tried include avocado  mac & cheese and chocolate with dry red pepper. But my favorite is pistachio  its creamy and has the right amount of nuttiness ( i think i invented a word there). Its not extremely sweet either. Art of Flavors also serves freshly baked cookies. They are also very good  if you are a bit of a sweet-tooth than I would recommend cookie-gelato sandwich.  Overall (5/5)  it doesn't matter if you are in the area or you making a trip to eat here. This is a must try place for ice-cream/gelato lovers.
7tZj_leriQz4AQMvXjpxfA	5	So  I had found this practice through their reviews on Yelp  and let me tell you that they live up to what is said about them. I have a very busy schedule and didn't realize how far they were from me (only about a 35 min drive) but their service really makes it worth it. Very professional and great team. Sara had cleaned my teeth and was so sweet and helpful! I was having a bad day the morning of my appointment  and they still let me in even though I was 30 mins late. Ha. Great place and quality work.
AWUwdwGv7R4R3z8k_wU0JQ	5	The tacos were amazing  wonderful service  and not expensive at all! This is the perfect mom and pop place to hit up in downtown Phoenix!
Gqk0A7mR5G5bPX1GMp6JJQ	5	Great service- The crew was on time and finished the job quickly. My tile is super clean thank you
00laTSZZiYKkDSN6c8J7jA	5	Carpet Monkeys have cleaned my carpets twice & each time they have been very prompt & customer-friendly. Their prices are far less than other carpet cleaning companies  and they do a fantastic job cleaning. I highly recommend their services!
CXZHjJrDMiV33gtSsqmhxQ	5	I let my fiancé borrow my truck and she ended up side swiping some orange barriers on the highway. Now I am the biggest uptight person when it comes to my cars/trucks. Me and my brother use to own a body and collision shop in Detroit so I know what to expect and what to look for in a shop. When I walked into Las Vegas collision I was impressed. The manager came out and introduced himself looked at the damage and we got to talking he took me into the shop showed me his setup the (best of the best) of everything so I knew I was in good hands. Set my appointment showed up next day to pick it up and the truck looked flawless. No cut corners or cost  fully detailed too!!!! Pure professionalism out of Las Vegas collision. The team over here is the real deal. Accidents happen but I know exactly where I'm going when it does. Thank you to everyone at Las Vegas collision!!!
JhsYarDOQYSy8y-wrwCHlA	5	This place was great. Good atmosphere  super kid friendly  and the ice cream was so good and unique!
mH0CGQSbUaXI3f4_dWrlOg	5	Both my daughter and I have had our iPhones repaired here! Great  fast affordable and friendly service! Hopefully I won't need to go back but if I do I know it will be fast and friendly service! Thank you!!!!
RRDHVkN_yHM4988jseV6_w	5	This is a great local place with a sad back story. A police officer wanted to get an ice cream truck to teach his kids about having a business but unfortunately died in the line of duty. Years later  the kids opened up this place. The ice cream truck dream and legacy lives on.  The ice cream is unique and they make it themselves. I had Captain Crunch ice cream made from the breakfast cereal. There's a bunch of flavors and there's samples if you aren't sure.  Customer service is great and the person at the register was friendly.  Overall  I think it is a great ice cream place and I like supporting local businesses.
QTce52jnrsgH2MY_4oBnLQ	3	Wow so I reserve my 4 & 5 star reviews for places I can't shut up about irl and consistently visit. While I have no real complaints about this joint  I don't understand the bevy of  zomg 1 000 000 stars! I want to have my babies here!  type reviews.   Went here after dinner on 2/1/14 with Beau S. for two reasons - 1# I noticed Chris R. mentioning or checking in to this place a bunch on Yelp & 2# I saw the article in the Weekly about their ice cream sandwich and figured it would be something Beau would be into.  We sampled a few of the flavors and I agree with another reviewer about the milky flavors. I settled on the small spicy chocolate and Beau got the medium guava sorbet and it came out to a bit over $8.   They weren't making the sandwiches at the time but maybe I was seeing things when I thought I saw a sign saying ice cream sandwiches were in the $6+ range. Yikes!  I commented to Beau that I wished they had an even smaller size available. While I didn't try it  I couldn't imagine trying 3+ oz of the smoked salmon gelato. My spicy chocolate was good but even 3 oz felt like a lot to me.   The dessert was good but I'd have to start craving this place for me to up the stars.
tV-0pw5GR2uHZMSvu5djJQ	5	Patrick did a great job cleaning my tile and grout.  He even arrived earlier  than expected and was very fast.  I would highly recommend their work to anyone.  I  will definitely be using their service again.
Zym0qDspJgMtqxoRhtNBzA	5	Such an adorable alternative to the frozen yogurt options that have saturated the market. Mighty Moos makes all of their own ice cream and you can tell they really enjoy what they do. The owners and staff are super friendly and they even have toys and a huge chalkboard for the kids. We'll definitely be going back!
kYkMlDWOwaQHBx2kHGhgEg	5	These guys were great! When requesting a quote they replied VERY quickly. The guy who did our carpets was very friendly & took his time to get the stains out. They use orange peels in their cleaning solution so instead of a chemical smell my place smelled nice & fruity. Will definitely be staying in touch with them.
UFgZFaGTqCCxGyM8HTrLCw	5	I have tried most of the hot dog vendors in the uptown area and  The Chili Man   is by far the best!  Also  you always get very good conversation while you wait!  What more could you ask for!
dzyDfgHFaRxPO_mL1Vdrhg	5	A truck and two SUV's and no problems. This place and Ryan and his boys got it together. I was kind of on a budget with my daughters cars and he helped me out with a great deal.                      Thank you ryan
FY-qE2JSw_BZEo4tgvu_aw	5	Travis & Lisa are the Best!  Our Olde English Pocket Beagle  Arwen  was hurt requiring spinal surgery. She was unable to conduct many normal activities. We had custom steps built to reach our bed so she would be able to safely enter and exit our bed without causing additional damage. The steps required carpeting to make it more user friendly so she does not slip or scrape her under belly. When we went to Affordable Flooring & More Travis & Lisa offered an unbeatable price but what was amazing was the exceptional quality of their work. You can easily see how they take pride in their work and pay attention to all the details.  I would recommend to anyone needing carpet to go to Affordable Flooring & More first and I intend to use their services in the future.
c8GruBVjkw9UECrobOmK4w	5	Kevin was very thorough when he did the inspection of the house we are considering buying.  He took many photos and went over everything with us in detail.  He took extra time to answer all of our questions and gave us his cell phone number in case we had any further questions.  He even stopped by to check on some repairs that the seller was to make when he was in the area.  Thanks for everything Kevin.
Wd1hN82r4x3u6ijPFkLr4A	2	My experience with this company was dissapointing. My carpets did look clean but that's because I had to pay for add ons to shampoo it. The person who came told me  it's like washing your hair with no shampoo  is your hair gonna be clean just by adding water?   Gross. So why do you sell carpet cleaning services if your price doesn't include the cleaning part? Anyhow  to have 3 rooms + the staircase  cleaned  I ended up paying over $150.00. P.s. I went with this company because of the glowing reviews. Nothing special. This service done back on July 2015.  In response to Hydrocare's comment: That's the best  sorry not sorry comment I've ever seen. If I go get an oil change I expect my car to get an oil change. Not get a car wash. Like I said  I didn't appreciate the guy telling me if you want your carpets clean then you have to pay to shampoo them. So you should advertise your service as  getting your carpets wet . I'm just a consumer leaving my two cents. Congratulations on your fantastic reviews.
CqjmV09n5jVngfS0dLChiA	5	Called for a water softener and whole house filter installation. Received an estimate literally half of the highest est I had already. Made an appointment thinking the estimate will go up when they get here. John arrived on time  looked at what I had installed everything even let me watch and bother him with conversation while he worked. Less than 2 hours later John was done explained how to work things and gave me a discount on the original est. Honest on time clean work and cheaper than estimated... What more could you ask for from a service?
8RIHVEusIW9uM0AnDBysdg	5	Great service and specials! I really liked Carly she takes her time you and answers all your questions! They don't oversell you like most places!
owVRvC2ZZpOJLNLb3g4pJQ	5	This tiny little out-of-the-way restaurant is amazing. The service is very friendly and fast  the food is fresh and wonderful. The menu basically only has chicken tacos  burritos and a salad. Chicken only  no beef or pork.  They probably have vegetarian items  but it didn't appear on the menu.
UdIXAlxEWNiTysQ37iVPug	5	I've never been happy with my brows and I'd been convinced there was just no way to fix them. UNTIL my first trip to Pink Cherry!   One session with Shaina and I'm closer than ever to the eyebrows I've always wanted. She is amazing  she took her time to ask what I didn't like about my eyebrows and explained exactly how I would achieve the eyebrows of my dreams .   Only came here because my usual place was too booked up and I was in a pinch  but I'm sooo glad I did! I definitely recommend Shaina if you are like me and need help with reshaping your brows.   My Brazilian was also quick and fairly painless. Shaina went over all after care procedures. I even got a call checking up on me after my appointment (although I was a little dismissive on the phone because I was at work). Amazing experience with Pink Cherry and I'll definitely be coming back!
W3Jqzoim33YsQqUnO61q6g	1	We have been Cox customers over 25 years  and 13 months ago  we signed up with their rep for a 2 year contract at a set price.  We were really happy....for a year. It really wasn't a set price.  Well after a year  our $135 bill jumped to $190.  So  our rep named Kyle (name given so you don't get suckered into a deal too) lied  and when I tried to contact him  I got no replies.  Anyhow  now I have been on the phone with Cox Communications in San Diego for a total of 6.75 hours over four different calls to fix our bill.  The last conversation with the  Loyalty Department  gave me a nice discount  and the woman said she was very sorry stating that  our service is appreciated.  She credited our late fee (??? wherever that came from)  and quoted us a nicer price  just a bit higher than our quoted contract rate a year before.  I THOUGHT it was finally fixed. We got our bill  and we were charged the  late fee  and the amount was $190 again.  I called again today  and this woman in the  Loyalty Department  never made any notes about her promises to me. Now  I have to begin all over again  and personally  I think we may end up paying the cancellation fee  no matter how high it is. My time is quite valuable  but obviously  25+ years means notHING to them.  I am SO disappointed in Cox here in San Diego.  Their  Loyalty Department  has ruined the company as a whole! When you sign up  PLEASE read all the super fine print that you need a magnifying glass to see.  They will lock you into something you didn't sign up for  and with the expertise that I have seen  you won't ever get it worked out. Good luck! I'll follow up IF this gets resolved.  Until then  I dislike Cox with a passion. Yes  they appreciate my loyalty....not! (BTW  their internet speed even at the highest is no comparison to U-Verse which was lightning fast!)

When I got there  there was a chair available right away. One of the ladies invited me to take the seat  but then she continued being on her phone. Not the greatest customer service! Although the process was fairly simple and I was happy with the shape  I noticed that she cut me several times on the skin under my eyebrows. If I return  I will only be going to Farida or her daughter.

All of them are amazing!  Also can't beat these prices for the serving size you get.  Will definitely be back!

In all honesty  I mainly went because he was so nice on the phone. He told me he was available to come to me (travel repair) or  I was welcome to come to the shop.   I'm not far from the business so I stopped in.   Everyone was so pleasant & I couldn't be happier to meet Akila. He was quick to offer water and even Netflix while we were seated in the waiting area. My phone is now brand new & from start to finish id say it was about 25min!   Fastest screen repair ever but  the overall experience was awesome. Customer service at its finest. I'm coming back soon to get my sisters phone repaired. Highly recommended

I hardly trust anyone to touch my hair because I fear they'll do what they like vs. what I ask for. This was not the case with Katie. She listened to exactly what I wanted  she is very passionate about what she does and a great conversationalist.  Also  one of the best priced places I have ever been to!

HDE has been my go-to place for a few years now. I call them 2-3/year  and they take care of any bug issues. We had a problem with Black Widows  and after HDE came out  no problem. My only issue is the dead bugs I find after they come through  which is not their problem  and means they've done their job very well. Thanks for keeping me from screeching in terror at a spider invasion...
PY7Pka7XQLf1JJzVNUXREA	1	they are un-ethical. they charge you for extra for stuff you did not want. then they do nothing about it when you talk to them. if you can go with someone else  you would be wise to do so.
diZPLAbK6RjqRHw6V7zDPQ	4	I needed a new mattress for my kid last summer  looked around and ended up at this place. Decent selection of mattresses with comparable prices to other mattress stores. But  they had a sale the weekend we were looking and it ended up a little cheaper than those other spots. Their sales people were friendly and informative and had a low pressure approach to selling  which we appreciated. After we bought a mattress it was delivered a couple days later  right around the time they estimated. Everything about the purchase was pain-free so they get a thumbs up from me.
