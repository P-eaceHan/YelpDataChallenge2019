I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.\\n\\nI\\'m gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don\\'t think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i\\'d give it a \"C\" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room. \\n\\nMmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren\\'t sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me. \\n\\nThe jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald\\'s apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it\\'s a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty. \\n\\nThey provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special. \\n\\nNot gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. I used the bathroom like 5 times. I don\\'t recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day.',\n",

I have tried so many different things from the menu and it never disappoints, but the Saturday night special Prime Rib and Horseradish Dauphinoise Potato is my favorite. Second, the service is amazing. Ian is my favorite waiter, will request him every time! He is so personable with a good sense of humor! He constantly is checking up to make sure everything is good (but not too much). He made the experience at the Arrogant Butcher memorable!',\n",

It's been on Diner's Dives and Drive Ins.\\n\\nIf it's your first time, go up to the counter (to the left of the cash registers) and ask for the orientation - they'll walk you through the ordering process, and give you samples of several of the dishes.  After you do that, grab an order form and pick a 2 item combo and choose 7 9 Black and White.  That's all your really need to know.  :-)  That's Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Black Beans and White Rice.  Jade Red Chicken is sort of their take on sweet and sour, but with a spicy twist.  Jerk Chicken is Jamaican influenced (and can be quite spicy some days).  The Black Beans are amazing - stir them into your rice (easier to eat both with your chopsticks when you do this).  And, did I mention, you get a snickerdoodle with your order?  Yep!  Best snickerdoodles around, and one comes with every dish!\\n\\nIf you haven't been to Chino's - it's time - make a run for the border/great wall/beach!\\n(and make sure to read the non-PC T-shirts while you wait - funny!)\",\n",

Believe it or not, we even thoroughly enjoyed dining outside in the August Scottsdale swelter- their misting system works amazingly well.\\n\\nWent with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It\\'s true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed! \\n\\nI had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn\\'t one crumb of food left on anyone\\'s plate! \\n\\nThe focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced. We were celebrating one of my daughter\\'s friend\\'s birthdays, so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an \"ice cream bar,\" which had ice cream, marshmallow, and lots of rich, luscious chocolate. It was totally delicious, and reminded us of a s\\'more.\\n\\nOlive & Ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront, and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in Europe. I will definitely be back- only wish we had an Olive & Ivy in Tucson!',\n",

       "  'text': \"This is a tricky one. AB is a really cool looking spot, really nice decor and ambiance, comfy booths, it even smells like a new car.\\n\\nMy group was greeted promptly by smiling hosts, and seated in a nice booth. Drink orders were placed, and when our margaritas arrived, they were really, really off and tasted terrible. Even after stirring, and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough, and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.\\n\\nFor an app we went with the pretzel fondue, thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything, but either bump up portion size, or drop the price from $16 to $11.50.\\n\\nI really liked our server, but for some reason as things went on, he was more and more absent. To be fair, we had a really difficult person that joined us, some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out, so I feel his pain.\\n\\nAnyway, AB is a very attractive spot that might be great for drinks and app. but for this price point, I would hit Durant's, Hillstone, or Beckett's Table. It's nice to leave a spot feeling that you got your monies worth, and that just doesn't happen here.\",\n",

We finished with the complementary dessert of chocolate triangles and a rose infused marshmallow roasted right at the table.\\n\\nOverall I'm very happy with our experience and the friendly service.

       "  'text': 'This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?\\n\\nThere are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue\\'s but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the \"membership line\" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  \\n\\nThe second line, is to \"check in\" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  \\n\\nBoth of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  \\n\\nAfter all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  \\n\\nThen, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  \\n\\nWe head to our bay with a \"bay concierge\" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  \\n\\nWe start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn\\'t know what a \"slider\" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.\\n\\nWhen the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, \"do you know one thing thats missing in this place?\"  The server leaned in all interested.... \"napkins - there are no napkins on the table\".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, \"could we have napkins?\" - and there was this \\'oh yeah\\' moment - he was oblivious at times.\\n\\nSo, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.\\n\\nThe kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn\\'t mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  \\n\\nOK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   \\n\\nAgain, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.',\n",

It was a good restaurant but had some pretty big negatives. \\n\\nThe first thing that I notice was how large the restaurant was. It seemed to go on forever. Which was amazing considering how quickly our food came out. They have an open kitchen so you can see how many people they have working in the kitchen. Needless to say it's busy. \\n\\nOne drawback as others have mentioned is the noise level. Fortunately my husband and I were sitting by drapery panels so the 2 of us could carry on a conversation. Others sitting more towards the inside of the restaurant would have a difficult time hearing each other. Another issue is that it is pretty dark. I understand ambiance but this was a little too much. They know this so they do compensate and make the print larger on the menu. When it came to eating and my food was the same color (fish and cauliflower) it was hard to tell exactly what I was putting on the fork.\\n\\nOur server was very good. Attentive and full of information when clarification was needed for the menu. We had Avocado bruschetta which was just okay. I should of skipped it. I ordered the Pacific Sea Bass. The fish was good and so was the cauliflower. They only thing I didn't care for was the preserved grapefruit. The funny thing is that while eating it I said to my husband that I didn't like the orange flavor that I was sometimes getting on the fish. It was either orange or when they preserve it then it totally changes the taste profile from grapefruit to orange. My husband had the lasagna bolognese.

The restaurant meals are cheap for what you get and word is out among the ASU students and young families. Pizza crust was chewy, crispy with just the right amount of char, like a good bread. Cannoli was outstanding, obviously had been freshly filled, as shell was perfectly crunchy and the sweet ricotta center had a nice clean flavor. Lows: Pasta and disorganization.  It was a packed Saturday night and they weren\\'t prepared. The wine glasses and forks ran out. They had a weird ordering system where there were two cash registers, one halfway through the line. When one of the staff would become available they would open the halfway register, which meant that someone who was lucky enough to be there at that moment would get to order early, in effect cutting in front of the rest of us who had been waiting longer. Our ravioli and filled shells came out lukewarm. As Yogi Berra once said, \"Nobody goes there anymore. It\\'s too crowded.\"',\n",

What a great name for a restaurant located in downtown Phoenix directly across from the Arizona Diamondbacks ball park. With a solid 4 stars and over 1200 reviews it had to be outstanding right? Unfortunately the arrogance overcame the actual experience that we received. Arriving during happy hour the restaurant was extremely dead, but spring break, vacations etc, I'm sure it's normal in Phoenix. The service was just ok, the server seemed to take forever for our drinks, food and even the check. The drinks were watered down and not mixed right, one tasted like vodka and my second was more tonic/cloudy. The food was also just ok, the oysters were terrible, burger average and the best dish by far was the pork nachos. I'm sure this place is outstanding and it was an off day. I'd give it a try again maybe for dinner then next time I'm in the area.\",\n",

I asked if this was the right one and it seems like there was a mix up on the order (not surprised, they were super busy on a friday night)\\n\\nTony came out and immediately apologized asked if we wanted to change it out. Since i hate being that customer, I told him now worries. Despite that Tony said he wanted us to still try it and was going to give us some slices for FREE. And I am so glad he did the sicilian pizza was amazing! Super fluffy, cheesy, saucy goodness. And the slices were huge!\\n\\nTony knows the value of customers and how to treat them right. I told tony we will be coming back (especially for the Sicilian) \\n\\nKey takeaways:\\n\\nOwner or Manager Tony is the man! He knows business and how to satisfy a customer. \\nFREE Garlic Knots\\nFREE slices of pizza\\n\\n5 Star Review all the way. Thank you Tony, we will be back.\",\n",

There wasn't really anything special about it as we found the brisket tough to chew and the cheeseburger just ordinary and nothing to write home about.

       "  'text': 'I\\'ve visited this location several times over the last few years and have always found the breakfast food to be good by the standards of most trendy breakfast places in the area. But the best? Not quite. Personally, it kind of hovers between the 3 and 4 star range for me.\\n\\nScrambled opts for the \"do it yourself\" approach to dining. You order your food at the counter and they\\'ll bring it out to you. You\\'re pretty much responsible for everything else, including silverware, sauces, napkins, and filling up your drink. Not that there\\'s anything wrong with that approach. I\\'m just not exactly sure what it is that you\\'re wanting me to provide a tip for? \\n\\nAnyway . . . \\n\\nWhatever you order, if it comes with hash browns, upgrade them to their \"scramble browns,\" which are probably one of the best creations they have. It\\'s traditional hash browns with cheese and bacon mixed in. We order it every time - without fail!\\n\\nI usually get the two eggs (scrambled w/cheese), that comes with bacon, bread, and upgraded scramble browns. My girlfriend prefers their strawberry French toast, which I\\'ve never really been all too impressed with - as it\\'s basically just the addition of some strawberry cream cheese.\\n\\nWe usually don\\'t go to breakfast during busy hours, but prefer visiting in the early afternoon to avoid the crowds. With most places, this is rarely a problem, but something was definitely off in the kitchen when we arrived 30 minutes before close. I received my order immediately, while my girlfriend never did. Apparently, they had forgotten about her. When she finally said something, I was practically finished with my plate. To top it off, the order they gave her was incorrect. Mistakes happen and they took care of us in the end, but the mishap did seem odd considering the place only had a handful of diners.\\n\\nBe warned that servings here are pretty small. With what you pay in comparison to some of the other places, don\\'t expect to take anything home.\\n\\nThe breakfast, although slightly overpriced and undersized, is still above average in comparison to many places in Phoenix. Maybe if I were a vegan, vegetarian, or anti-gluten, I\\'d rate it more highly. The dog-friendly patio is a nice addition.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth a visit if nothing else.',\n",

I give kudos to the hostesses for helping us pull together several tables and being patient while we waited for our colleagues to arrive after they got lost.\\n\\nSort of strange though how we would order drinks from our server and each time they would get delivered it would be a different server and we kept having to tell the drink delivery person who ordered what.  \\n\\nPersonally the drinks are overpriced at $9 for Bombay Gin for example.   My co-workers who were drinking though the drinks were weak especially at the $9 mark.  Likewise it took three people to find me a glass of water without ice and lemon.\\n\\nThe food was just okay - but when you pay these prices and are in a trendy location I really expected more.  Two dishes out of 10 people were sent back and finally one was removed from the bill.  The sea salt chips were great as an appetizer but I thought my salmon was really overcooked.  Again, it wasn\\'t bad, but I expected more.\\n\\nI probably wouldn\\'t go back, as when I travel I like to find really good places to eat and when the place doesn\\'t give me a good vibe I just move on to discover something else.  I wish them the best, but it seemed like the customers were there more because it was the \"trendy place to go\" and not because the food was outstanding. \\n\\n Again, I think the hostesses did the most, the original server was great - but in a party of 10 we shouldn\\'t have to raise our hands to see who ordered what each time the drinks arrived.  I would expect than at a place for beer specials and not an average of $9 bucks a pop.',\n",

With my fiancé, girl friends, and solo when I'm taking myself out to a fancy date :P. The ambiance is everything- I really like the music, the lighting, the décor. They have a nice bar with two TVs,and across from it,little community tables which are all open seating. The restaurant is quite large and there's plenty of seating inside and outside as well. The view whilst sitting outside is really pretty- they often have lights, you can see the bridge and canal, etc. The crowd is all ages- I love that everyone dresses up and makes an effort- whether it's families with toddlers, first dates or a group of friends. On weekends I think they have a DJ. I typically always get the all natural chicken and lamb meatballs- they're delicious. I've tried the flatbreads, and other chicken (can't remember the name) those were all good too. Their deserts change but all have been really delicious. The wine selection is ok, beer not so much, but the cocktails are pretty tasty. They also have a bakery/market at the other end with gelato. The bathrooms are always clean and the service is good. My only complaint is that they've started being a little stingy on their portions- dining in and take away. The wine pour is also small! But overall, still my top few places in Scottsdale.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Ok, so my wife and I have been coming here on and off for the last year, probably about 10 times. This is the first time I\\'ve felt compelled to write a review. \\nI work in customer service, and have worked in customer service for about 20 years. Customer perception is reality. The girls at the hostess area/computer/thing just don\\'t seem to have any desire to assist. My wife and I had a reservation tonight for 7:45. Our plans changed and we arrived early, around 6. We asked if we could be seated earlier, and they said no problem. Here it is, 7:05, and plenty of people have walked in and been seated after we came in. I walked up around 6:30, and they said it would be a \"couple\" minutes. As my wife and I sit here and see the empty clean tables, that have been empty and clean since we arrived, I myself am beginning to wonder if we slipped through the cracks or something. I must have forgot to take off my invisibility cloak or something. All 4 of these ladies are just standing there, talking and chatting, and help more people as they come in, and get seated. Needless to say, this is a pretty long review because I have lots of free time while I wait to be seated with my wife. At this point, looks like we are going to be seated at our original reservation time. Arrogant Butcher, you may have lost a loyal customer......\\nI started off this review with 4 stars, and have since dropped it to 2, as I\\'m sitting here, waiting to be seated.....\\nUPDATE:\\nJust moved it back to 4 stars, thanks to Alec (spelling) one of the managers, who personally came by our table because he saw this review on Yelp. I have to say, being a manager myself, it means a lot to face an upset customer, especially while they are still in the restaurant. Kudos to him, and the ownership for having him as a manager. \\nI did tell him that other than the initial aspect to our visit, everything else, from the wait staff, to the food, has been amazing. Thanks for helping us make our night of celebration easier.',\n",

Back in L.A., they\\'re just now discovering fusion food and it\\'s roaming around the city in lunchtrucks using Twitter to guide their customers. This brick-and-mortar place has been around for 20 years. \\n\\nOn walking in, we were greeted with, \"Is this your first time? I\\'ve got samples for you!\" with a kind worker behind the counter giving us tastings of several of the meats, rice and beans. \\n\\nI got a combo with a jerked chicken quesadilla, a pile of the red jade chicken, pork fried rice and refried beans, and I wasn\\'t disappointed with any of it. Jerked chicken was REALLY spicy, but damn good. Outstanding blend of food. It transported well (took it to-go) and tasted just as good the next day after 2 minutes in the microwave. \\n\\nAnd it\\'s so easy to get into the spirit of the place. \\n\\nWhile waiting for our order, these two guys came in and started taking pictures posing with the autographed poster of Guy Fieri and checking out all of the news clippings on the wall. While they discussed what they might want to try, I mentioned that if it\\'s their first time, they can sample the food. Their eyes lit up and they raced to the counter where another nice worker gave them sample cups of everything.

       "  'text': 'One of, if not the best, restaurant experiences we\\'ve ever had. My husband and I came to Scottsdale for our babymoon, we\\'re expecting our first child. We walked into Olive & Ivy, no reservations, and were told that the wait inside was 2 hours but they could sit us in the patio. We took their offer and glad we did. Our server, Miranda, was attentive from the moment we sat down. She got our drinks right away. I asked if their feta was pasteurized & explained how there are certain cheeses I can\\'t have since I\\'m pregnant. So we ordered the hummus for an app but no feta to be safe since she wasn\\'t sure. Miranda still followed up with the kitchen to ask about their cheeses being pasteurized or not (which most are), and then we ordered the \"Natural Chicken\" and their ravioli. Radom servers would walk by to refill our waters when needed, food came out quick. My husband went and ordered a mojito, my favorite drink and I joked about how he\\'s torturing me, but she offered a virgin mojito and took her up on it! My husband said it was the best mojito he\\'s ever had and the virgin drink tasted almost identical. \\nToward the end of our meal, Miranda brought dessert menus and said, \"Dessert is on me, pick what you\\'d like!\" We were floored. We ordered the caramelized cake (AMAZING). At first we didn\\'t understand why, and when the dessert came out, it said \"Congratulations!\" with a pink and blue candle. We so impressed with the food and service we asked for the manager, Jimmy. He was hospitable, respected by his employees by the way they interacted with him, and even had me try two of his favorite gelatos. \\nSuffice to say our dinner experience was incredible. Both my husband and I were servers for a number of years, so for us to have great service from the hosts, bussers, and other servers, was pretty great.',\n",

Some fun entertainment that we can rave about in AZ!! \\n\\nPrepare yourselves with a golf glove instead of coming here on a whim (aka me) to avoid the possible blister on your thumb from gripping the golf club too tight. Came here before the 5pm rush for $35/hour. This place is great for groups. With your lifetime membership for $5 plus tax you can save every score that you ever made and check up on your scores. Waitresses/waiters will be at your bay to take your food/beverage orders. There are tv monitors if you really don't want to play golf too. Plushy couches to sit comfortably on for a party of 6. And there are misters to somewhat cool you off in the summer heat. \\n\\nImmediately got a bay in less than 5 minutes. Took the top view and awfully attempted to score points based on accuracy but failed miserably. Let's just say I would not want to share my score. I just have to come back and practice more. Also played pool downstairs and virtual darts. This entire place is busy on the weekends. You don't have to be in golf attire. Comfy clothes like flip flops, tank and shorts are good enough.  \\n\\nCan't wait for the San Tan location to open up!!\",\n",

Almost as good as my favorite place in Maui (Sansei). \\n\\nStuffed Jalapenos - You did what with that pepper? You stuffed it with crab and tempura'd that garnish from south of the border? Yeah, and it works. \\n\\nRamen - Hey, you can't pass up an chance to have Ramen that isn't out of a bag! We really didn't expect the kick that this ramen had, but luckily for me it was so spicy that it was all mine to slurp and gulp!! No dry seasoning packets used in this bowl.

I was skeptical, but now impressed. The enchiladas are, I mean, REALLY good. I had one of each kind of tortilla, beef, with red & green sauce and both kinds of cheese. I had them sprinkle some cotija on top with just a taste of the jalapeno ranch sauce. It was perfect! I got chips and salsa on the side as well as the Honey V slaw. The slaw is really good, wish they served it in a bigger dish. The salsas were also good. BUT, the chips were nasty. They tasted like they were cooked in rancid oil. Not sure if it's just the kind of oil they use or if they in fact used old oil to make them. So I dont recommend the chips. But don't be like me and judge it before you try it. It's definitely worth your time. Yum!\",\n",

Although, it is truly a verbatim Happy Hour that ends at 6pm.  Not the biggest fan of a short happy hour, but I understand that Downtown doesn't draw the same volume of people after work as Tempe or Scottsdale.\\n\\nWe decided to sit at the hightop bar so we could get a great view of the place.  It's a very open concept with a nice view into the hustling kitchen and outward view of the US Airways Center.  Great urban vibe.\\n\\nThe food is where it fell a little short. The Salmon sounded great with farro, fennel, and roasted apples, but didn't live up to it's $22 price tag.  Portion size was decent, but nothing outstanding about the flavor.  Maybe my time in NYC has spoiled my taste buds.\\n\\nOur bartender was also a bourbon drinker and recommended the Candlestick Maker.  She made a great drink.  I tried the Turkey Sloppy Joe feeling that the poblano peppers would pair well with the bourbon, but should have trusted my gut and figured that the sloppy joe was probably part of the kids menu.  Could really use some more zest and kick.\\n\\nOverall, it's a nice addition to CityScape and will definitely try to make happy hour again.\\n\\nOh, the Artichoke Hummus was the best part of the night.

My octopus crepe was served on 3 small crepes open faced. Because the crepes were thin, and the filling plentiful but crumbly it was hard to get a good bite of filling with crepe. I loved the presentation but I think having a more traditional folded up crepe would make it easier to eat the dish. In general the octopus was tender and flavorful but was slightly chewier than the amazing octopus dish at Virtu and Nico's Heirloom Kitchen. The chorizo in the dish was decent, but after a while I was wishing there were a slightly sweet element in the dish to balance out all the salty flavors. Perhaps a small squeeze of orange would help brighten up the dish.\\n\\nI tried a bit of the tahini chicken crepe which had a lovely balance of flavors and textures. The chickpeas were a wonderful surprise as they were dehydrated so they tasted crispy and light.\\n\\nOur dulce de leche crepe for dessert was amazing. The fresh slices of creamy banana went well with the soft crepe, lightly sweet sauce, and crunchy candied pepitas. I would definitely order this again (And again, and again)!\\n\\nI ordered a Moroccan spiced almond milk latte, which had a subtle hint of exotic spice with a light flavor of honey. It was a well balanced drink. Note that the hot drinks (At least with my latte) are served in a cup that has no handle. My hands got a bit sticky since some of the coffee and milk spilled off the side and I had to grip the cup with both my hands to drink it (First world problems, right?). \\n\\nOverall, it was an enjoyable experience. I will definitely come back again! Upgrade one star.\",\n",

Of course, we had no such luck here. It might be 11:45am, and it might be 115 degrees out, the hole, the big hole in the wall place was packed, and the line was out the door. \\nAnyway, they have a sampling station for newbies on the left side of the counter. I got a chance to try a few different dishes before I settle on the order. It makes the place a zoo, but I like the concept. After all, most food here are somewhat pre-cooked.\\nSo what does Chinese Mexican or Mexican Chinese taste like?\\nI can't really describe it. It's new to me. I know I fully enjoyed the diablo pork, emerald chicken and most important of all, the jerked fried chicken. Ok there is nothing chinese or mexican about jerked fried chicken, but it's still a creative fusion dish, a perfect one for that matter.\\nWhen the girl brought the food over, I just couldn't wait to redirect the food right into my mouth. Before she reached me, she slipped!\\nI managed to saved the food, both plates. Only 2 things dropped, the snicker doodle and the girl. I feel really bad that I wasn't able to keep her from falling, but I saved the food!!\\n\\nExtras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.8\\n\\nService 0.2: She probably bruised her behind delivering food to me, I've gotta leave full score here.\\n \\nDecor 0.1: It's old, ugly, but somewhat special. It looks like an expanded cafeteria.  \\n\\nSpeed 0.2: Even with the line out the door, they still make very good progress. The food gets on your table FAST. \\n\\nDessert 0.1: good snicker doodle \\n\\nPrices 0.2: It's more than reasonable. Chinese take out prices for a great fusion creation? It's cheap. \\n\\nMy score for this experience is 4.3 stars.\\nFor a chance at the oddest and the most delicious creation on earth, it's no doubt a 5 star in my heart and my stomach.\\n\\nP.S.

I have always had fun and a great experience.\\n\\nToday I carried in my clubs to join a friend for her birthday party and we all had a very positive experience. We all laughed, ate, had a few drinks, and shared a fun time together. While wrapping up our visit, it was my turn to finish up my round. \\n\\nI grabbed one of my clubs, placed my ball on the tee, and in my back swing, some guy dressed in a football jersey yelled at me and told me that I couldn't use a hybrid or a wood. To a bunch of amateurs who rarely golf, and most of us had never been, we were all left confused with the interaction.  Without staying around to answer questions or clarify, he angrily told us to not use our own clubs and then left.  I honestly thought he was from the bay next to us, then realized he was an employee. We were all left standing there, kind of shocked. \\n\\nNobody had said not to use our own clubs. Nobody had explained woods, hybrids, etc. that may seem elementary, but to those of us who don't golf regularly, it came across extremely rude. \\n\\nOur waitress was very apologetic, and came over and apologized to me and the group. The manager came and expressed similar sentiments. It was such an odd, out of place interaction. \\n\\nOverall it was a great experience, but for someone who is representing such a great company and establishment who is out of uniform to come and belittle, criticize, and then not try to professionally address the situation, it was very shocking. I can only hope that they move forward without him.\",\n",

There was a young lady at the counter, taking orders, and another stocking juices nearby. Both were very friendly. \\n\\nI requested a vegan menu (the vegan options didn't seem to be listed on the large menu near the door), which was quickly furnished to me. There were 2 tofu scrambles, a soy chorizo breakfast burrito and french toast as possible choices. I couldn't decide between the veggie scramble or the french toast, so... I ordered both! My boyfriend went with the bacon and mushroom omelet (off the regular menu). We were offered bread options of white, wheat, rye, or an english muffin. The side dishes were fruit or sweet potato hash... and I think a lot of the menu items come with rosemary potatoes, but we both opted for the hash. The cashier gave us our number. It was a beautiful day, so we found a table outside.\\n\\nIn a matter of very few minutes, our food had arrived. I noticed that the vegan items were on red plates to differentiate them. My scramble was yummy, with a good enough amount of veggies in it, and a bit more wet than most other scrambles I've had. I did find myself wishing the portion was a bit larger. \\n\\nThe order of french toast came with 3 good-sized pieces and was super duper good.\\n\\nThe highlight for me, was the amazing sweet potato hash! It's served in a patty and is chock full of onions, zucchini, carrots (I think) and seasoned with rosemary. I've never had anything like it. I highly recommend it.\\n\\nMy boyfriend did seem to enjoy his omelet and definitely agreed with me on the hash.\\n\\nScramble is a great place, especially considering their vegan breakfast options, which are far too few-and-far-between in the valley. We will absolutely be back!\",\n",

My friend ordered from the sweet side and I ordered from the savory side.  It was really hard to choose with so many creative combinations!  I chose the Grand Prix, which is a coffee crepe, large cubes of pork belly, small cubes of pork jowl, an \"egg up\" as they call it, with some maple syrup to enhance everything.  My friend got the Cherry French Toast (not the menu name-they have a much more clever name than that).  It was large enough that she shared a quarter piece of the 1\" thick toast with me.  What we both noticed pretty quickly is that this kitchen likes to offset the sweet with a good dose of salt--think of salted caramel.  I ate all of mine but my friend couldn\\'t finish hers.

From the brisket, to the pulled pork, to their awesome mexicorn, this place does not disappoint!   Very evident also when you hear the other patrons oohing and ahhing over their meal.  DON'T LET THE GAS STATION/DETAIL SHOP FACADE FOOL YOU!  The reviews are real!  A must try for the bbq enthusiast.  Oh, and the baked beans are AUHMAZING too!\",\n",

The pork was tender, juicy and great smoke flavor. Mac was delicious and the slaw was perfect for the sandwich side. My wife had the smoked chicken and it was amazing. Juicy, fall apart perfection with enough smoke flavor to compliment, not overpower the chicken flavor. Her cornbread was homemade and the baked beans were sweet and rich. \\n\\nThe star of the show was the Brisket Stack. Tender, juicy lean brisket with a gorgeous smoke ring, over homemade hash browns topped with 2 fried eggs and a chili aolli. Bring your appetite because this thing is one of the best bbq combos I have ever had. The multiple dining areas are very nice and clean and the folks here are very friendly. \\n\\nOn top of all that, you can fill up your car, get it washed and detailed, get baked goods, beer, wine and chatchkies out the wazoo.  \\n\\nThe Thumb is absolutely one of kind and worth the trip. If we come back to Scottsdale, it will be on our places to visit again.',\n",

One final attempt today was the Eggplant Parmesan Hero. Well the eggplant was a white color and there was no breading at all on that white eggplant. It was one of the worst versions of this classic I even seen and their chicken parm did equal injustice to that dish a few months back. Not sure what goes on in the back of the kitchen, but I can tell you that I didn't see any Italians back there if you get my drift. The seeded roll with mozzarella cheese became my $8 lunch. Not returning to this place and who the hell wants to wait 30 minutes for a takeout order? They just say that on the phone to give you the illusion that they are high and mighty, like a club with a line outside and no people inside. Uncle Sal's is real better up the street.

Unless you like fake western hokey crap stores and indian flute music, you\\'ll want to barf. Of course, when you walk into Cien Agaves, you\\'re transported to a different type of atmosphere instantaneously. \\n\\nThey score with Moises\\' art on the walls, with the industrial looking staircase in the middle of the restaurant, and the generally good soundtrack. There are parts of the restaurant that feel like the divey little places you\\'d find in Guadalupe, and other parts feel like a Tempe college kid bar. None of it, however, feels like a nice restaurant. The diamond plating in the restrooms is oddly reminiscent of a shotty strip club. \\n\\nThe food here was about what I would expect. Not as good as The Mission, Barrio Cafe, Los Sombreros, etc. But much more interesting than a place like Los Olivos. They offer about a dozen different tacos with all sorts of seafood, meat, and bird. Service on my visit was a little slow. We waited about 15 minutes for our check and finally asked for it. Who knows how long we would have waited otherwise. \\n\\nMy main observation while here was the crowd. Even though the restaurant feels like the divey Tempe college kid restaurant, the crowd it draws is a little different. There were quite a few roided up douchebags with spider web tattoos, affliction shirts, and stupid gay shit eating grins with some fake tittied blonde with a nosejob hanging on them. It kind of seemed like a bar for Scottsdale douchebags when they want to \"slum it\" and have \"mexican\" food.\\n\\nI\\'ll probably go back eventually, but if you\\'re looking for a place to have good Mexican food, skip Cien Agaves. If you want to sip a few Coronas and have some tacos and salsa, you\\'ll be happy as a clam here.',\n",

Now im not from New York but ive visited many times and eaten there and nor am i a ridiculous pizza snob so with that being said..I got two cheese slices for about $6 .  The service was good and prompt so no complaints there.  The pizza i got litteraly tasted like frozen pizza. There is no way in hell anybody can convince me that this is even remotely close to new york pizza. There was absolutely NOTHING special about it. It was very disappointing. I had heard that the cheese was incredible but it wasnt. This is  like the 5th place on yelp ive tried because of GREAT yelp reviews and ive come to the conclusion that people get hyped up for anything. Honestly no joke Venezias is way better and tastier. I even prefer a costco pizza over this place.  AWFUL and never again will i eat there. Waste of time and money!! Order dominos and do yourself a favor!',\n",

They are quite delicious. There are also good vegetarian options available. \\n\\nI also wish there was a good enchilada and soup combo meal.  It's more of a pick one entree either or kinda thing. I mean the name is enchiladas AND soup, not OR.  \\n\\nAlso, the sneeze guard is awkwardly placed making it very difficult to hear the employees.\\n\\nI guess I feel a little overly critical especially in light of the o so many positive reviews but  guess I can't help how I feel. \\n\\nOne more thing.\\nTIP: make sure you get the sour cream on the side unless you want a big white pool of melted liquid sour cream engulfing your enchilada. The enchiladas are cooked in their plate leaving the plates very hot and they instantly transform a hearty clump of sour cream into liquid.\\n\\nUpdate 7/29/2014: Seems as though they've worked out the kinks. There is still quite a bit of a lunch rush so If you are pressed for time it might not be the best place to go but otherwise it's worth the wait.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I'm about to change your life in three words: \\nChile Relleno Burrito. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, everything at Chino's is exceptional. It's not fine dinning, but it hits the spot whenever I'm craving something out of the ordinary and affordable. Do you have the munchies right now? If so, stop reading and head to Chino's. I've been eating here since I was a teenager, or rather, I should say feasting here. \\n\\n\\nThe ordering style at Chino's leaves you with the ability to create your own meal. Typically, I choose the two item combo which comes with rice and beans. Now, you cannot go wrong with either the black beans or pinto beans. I have a hard time making that life choice between the two. Perhaps I'm biased, but I prefer their plain fried rice overall. Once those sides are taken care of, I make the first entree item choice of a Chinese food inspired meat. Honestly, they're all good choices but I find myself getting the teriyaki chicken most often. \\n\\nHowever, my next choice is where the real magic happens. Chile Relleno Burrito. Yes. Yes, you read that right. Now, Chino's Chile Relleno is amazing in and of itself. This is due to the delicious crunchy goodness that they surround their chile it in; I think it's crackers! Ritz, maybe? Delicious, most definitely! Now, imagine that wrapped in more cheesy goodness and a tortilla. Heaven. You've got heaven.\",\n",

However, we were half way through our food and our bay only had 5 minutes left and our server mentioned lengthening our time (we already did once) and we passed because we just wanted to finish our food and leave. We spent $100 at the bar and our bill was $270 at our table. This man, Richard, came out asking us to move to the \"free\" section mid bite. That was probably the most insulting thing he said as if we didn\\'t just spend $370 before a tip. He kept going on and on about the \"policy\" etc. we would have understood if it was 8pm on a Friday or Saturday and it was packed with a wait but it was 10pm on a Tuesday and there were all free bays in sight. My family is in town visiting me and we were trying to enjoy each other\\'s company. We are reasonable and if we planned on staying to \"party\" we surely would have moved. Our family owns restaurants in PA so we know customer service and understand occupying servers tables. Richard should have came over, said hello, thanked us for coming and made the bay idle long enough for us to finish our meal. He should have given her a table out of her section to make up for us staying there (which idk what there would have been to make up for.. a $55 tip..?) and just confirmed we weren\\'t there to party. I have never experienced anything like this in my life and is a sure way to keep people away from Top Golf. Such a disappointment.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I haven\\'t heard the exclamation, \"Gadzooks!\" since watching an English drawing room comedy on TCM during Alec Guinness Week or something equally British and old timey. It\\'s a great exclamation. Like, \"Zounds!\" or \"Sacré Bleu!\" or \"Bollocks!\" Things Americans don\\'t say. We usually just say the \"F\" word.\\n\\nSo when we checked out the newly renovated and freshly opened \"Gadzooks: Enchiladas & Soup\" in a 40-year-old building that was originally a filling station, then Miriam\\'s Designer Clothes (FYI: Miriam was not on Project Runway), we naturally said, \"Gadzooks! There\\'s a new restaurant in town!\" When we tried it out, we said, \"The F-word! These are darn good!\"\\n\\nDang! I mean, who doesn\\'t love a great enchilada, right? We feel a little territorial about things like enchiladas here in the Southwest, too, because we do them so well. Cincinnati may have its Skyline Chili. New Orleans has its jambalaya. Coney Island has its hot dogs. We\\'ve got amazing Mexican food here.\\n\\nOy! So when cute, scruffy, friendly owner Aaron Pool graduated from ASU he followed his dream: he opened an \\'Enchiladeria,\\' let\\'s call it. But Aaron\\'s vision is unique: you can customize what\\'s really a genuinely handmade enchilada with a variety of fillings, toppings, sauces and condiments. When Aaron had this, \"A ha!\" moment he said, \"Gadzooks!\" The rest, as they say, is history.\\n\\nGosh! Once you enter Aaron\\'s clean, bright, airy \"enchiladeria\" you\\'ll see the menu posted above the friendly assembly line where someone like the totes adorbs inky Eric will help you navigate your way through \\'Lada Land. You\\'ll see the fresh tortillas being pressed right before your very eyes. Choose either corn or the half \\'n\\' half corn & flour tortilla. They\\'re thick, fluffy; big on texture and taste. If you\\'re not in an enchilada mood, try a street taco. You\\'ll get two of either, and stuff \\'em with something like Roasted Tomatillo Chicken, Green Chile Pork Shoulder, Guajillo Braised Short Ribs, the melt-in-your-mouth Modelo Braised Bison, or other succulent stuffings. I happen to be a fan of the Sauteed Spinach Mushroom, too. Aaron\\'s up with the \"pollos\" preparing the succulent viands at 4 a.m. No kidding!\\n\\nBoo-ya! Smother it! Pick your sauce, pardner! Red, Green or \"Christmas\" style with both. They pop these comidas into a stone oven, and you get it piping hot.\\n\\nZoinks! You\\'ve also got time to add salsa-- and they\\'ve got four to choose from. Mix \\'n\\' match! Top it with scratch-made crema (a smooth, Mexican sour\\ncream), cotija cheese, a crunchy, crisp cole slaw (we think it\\'s fierce) and for a dollar more add sharp & creamy goat cheese, a griddle-fried egg or hand-smashed guacamole that\\'s already rumored to be gaining a tasty reputation. Through the miracle of math, they\\'ve determined that there are 2,638,594 different combinations available. You won\\'t get bored, believe me. You can even get a box of six enchiladas or tacos for $15 each to perk up your party. Talk about a bargain!\\n\\n¡Ay karamba! Now you\\'ve got yourself a pair of fine enchiladas or tacos, señors y señoritas! A pair is right around the $6.75 mark and you can add a third for only $2 more.\\n\\nHey! Prefer something lighter\"? Opt for a customizable, freshly chopped salad for $6.75. Feeling carnivorous? Add some meat for about two bits or so.\\n\\nDang! Soup is given short-shrift here with only one to choose from. (We hoped the \"soup\" might be plural. It isn\\'t.) It\\'s a dilly, however. It\\'s Linda\\'s (that\\'s Aaron\\'s frequently on-site mom) who offers up a delicious housemade Tortilla Soup for $3.95. We can\\'t help but wish it came in a bowl, however, instead of a paper \"to-go\"- style cup.\\n\\n¡Olé! If you really want a fiesta, try their 7th Street Sangria, Osborn Oro Margarita for $4 each, or a cool cerveza. That means, \"beer.\" Currently \"piped in,\" we\\'re hoping they\\'ll start brewing their ice tea, soon. Hint, hint.\\n\\nGadzooks! And that, amigos, is what they call, \"the whole enchilada.\" You might even say the \"F\" word after you try \\'em.',\n",

For example, my medium rare tuna arrived medium well because I wouldn't order it rare. There appeared to be little service training: when ordering wines by the glass, the waiter said that is what we call it even if it is wrong, when he missed one of the ladies in our party during the drink order, there was no apology just a flip comment from the waiter that clearly offended her. The staff clearly has the priority and walked thru parties while they were being seated rather than taking the 2 extra steps to walk around. It is a shame, since this a nice place with good food at a reasonable price and everyone in our party enjoyed their food but the waiter ruined it for some of us and there are so many good alternatives close by.\",\n",

If you like peanut butter and chocolate, this is your dessert!  \\n\\nNow, let's back up a bit and go back to the beginning part of my meal.  I had the tabbouleh salad and crab stuffed chicken.  I guess we were all thinking in synch because everyone at my table ordered the same thing.  The only odd thing is that one of the 4 people had a slightly smaller chicken piece.  Other than that, the dinner was delicious.  We sat in the outdoor seating, but I stepped inside periodically to check out the eclectic decor inside.  Lots of big screen TVs everywhere for sports fans.  Service was a little slow at first. Meaning, it took forever for them to bring waters and the drink orders, but once they did the food arrived not long after. But, we were part of a large group so that may have been part of the reason.   I would say It is still a solid place to have dinner with a large group.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'OMG! I wish we had a TopGolf here in San Diego. Please....come to San Diego!  We stopped in here while we were visiting family in Phoenix as a fun little day outing. I\\'m a big golfer so was a little hesitant on what this \"Top Golf\" was all about but it turned out to be SO MUCH FUN!\\n\\nIf you\\'re not familiar with Top Golf, it\\'s like a driving range on steroids. No, on crack! First off, the facilities were gorgeous and very well organized. You are greeted right when you walk in, there is an area to the right to check in and get your clubs if you don\\'t have any--and then you\\'re escorted to your private section. Each station has a terminal/computer where you enter the player names and the games you wish to play.  \\n\\nWhat I loved most was how each area was under a large covered patio to protect you from the elements and each had a very comfortable seating area with tables where you can sit, relax, order appetizers, drinks and even have a full blown lunch/dinner if you wanted. While everyone was ordering cocktails, I was so grateful they had an all natural Ginger Ale. I was going to town with those babies. \\n\\nWe had 4 people in our party and we all had different skill levels so the pre programmed games were perfect. I can\\'t recall the names of the games we selected but random targets were given and each of us had a certain amount of balls to hit each one. The closer you got to the target, the more points you got. It was an absolute blast. I also had limitations because I\\'m preggo but it could not have been a more perfect outing for us. We were having so much fun, we played for hours. \\n\\nThe table service was fantastic and they\\'re on it. As soon as our drinks or appetizers were getting low, they replenished quickly. We thought their prices on the food were pretty reasonable too. We thought we would only be there for an hour to play one game...we ended up spending hours there. \\n\\nI\\'m sure we\\'ll be back again during one of our annual trips out to Phoenix.',\n",

I\\'ll use my last visit to illustrate:\\n\\nI finally got a chance to bring my dad to Top Golf. I already knew we weren\\'t permitted to use drivers, woods, or hybrids (ridiculous) but we showed up at about 11:15am this day only to be told that as of THAT day, we can only hit our clubs from the first floor. This was a huge let down for me, especially since I had brought my new clubs with me. My dad goes with the flow so he said don\\'t worry about it, the first floor is fine - because of course I wanted to play with my new clubs. So we were sent all the way to the end of the first floor (bay 103 to be exact) where the computers were broken, everything was dusty and dirty, and we got no service. Literally 25 minutes later we still hadn\\'t even sat down, nor could we even get water because there wasn\\'t a server in sight. Thirty minutes later, luckily we finally had a server and the computers were fixed because we had two other people that met us there about 11:45 to play. Our server was overly apologetic and awkward but at least the food was good.\\n\\nIt would have been nice if they had just offered to move us to a different bay? Not sure why they couldn\\'t manage to do that. \\n\\nI really wish they would come up with some kind of system where everyone has the opportunity to play with their FULL set of clubs and if you hit it over the fence once, that\\'s it - you\\'re out. I understand life isn\\'t fair and they are \"fixing the fence\" or whatever but it would be so much more fun if we could use all of our clubs, on all of the levels, especially the girls! My boyfriend and I were planning on doing the Monday night tournament together but after this last visit we definitely changed our minds.\\n\\nIf I come back, it will probably only be for the nachos.',\n",

Ive found a couple of good places out here (slim pickings) but their dough is a bit tough and chewy.  The dough here was much better and very close to having a NY slice. Plus garlic knots were spot on, small, garlicky, Park cheese and fresh parsley on them. Great place!\",\n",

I got a full chicken parmigiana sandwich on focaccia bread, fiancée got turkey breast and provolone on wheat.

       "  'text': 'A fried egg?  With Green Chile?  Okay, well, I\\'m feeling open-minded, which does not often happen with Green Chile, so I go for it.  To be fair, it seems like every time a Chef wants to differentiate, he tosses a fried egg on it, \"There!  Magnifique!\"  Well, okay, this time it works.  I am a green-chile snob and I fall in the camp of \"it\\'s not chile if it has beans in it\", so again, dubious about this concoction of Short-Rib Green Chile stew, I tried it anyway.  \\n\\nThe yolk from the perfectly cooked sunny-side up egg blended into the chile, quickly disappearing while adding a rich texture to the savory sauce.  For me, the chile spice was a bit mild, although it did have a pleasant afterburn that let you know this was a southwestern dish.  This was a thick stew of tender beef, beans and chiles served with a moist, buttery cornbread muffin on the side.  While I could dicker about the ingredients, I cannot argue that it was not tasty, albeit a bit on the salty side.  Washed down with a smooth Kiltlifter Scottish Ale from Four Peaks was a perfect choice.\\n\\nMy wife had the Chicken Stroganoff, a pappardelle noodle dish with a sauce that reminded her of Coq au Vin.  Peas and mushrooms complimented the sliced chicken, making this dish a winner.  Youngest daughter had grilled Salmon with fried potatoes and had no complaints.  It\\'s difficult to get any sort of description from the young ones, so as long as she liked it, which she did, I consider it a winner.\\n\\nKids had the salted caramel pudding dessert and raved about it.\\n\\nThe one thing that was a big negative for me was the service.  Impersonal is the word that comes to mind.  \"Hands-off\" is a phrase that comes to mind.  While the server did his job adequately, he was slow at everything, and did not check back until we were practically done with our meal.  I wish he could have been more present.',\n",

The calzone was extremely generous with cheese, I'm big on cheese so I loved it.  (10/10)\\n\\nThe Dessert:\\nI had the pleasure of trying the zeppolis. They were fresh baked and tasted doughy (in a good way), with a light sweetness to them. I recommend them if you don't want to eat something too sweet, great quality. (9/10)\\n\\nThe Service:\\nThe owners were very friendly and welcoming. They ask for your name and remember it throughout your visit. Since it was our first time visiting, the garlic knots were free. The food we wanted was made from scratch, so naturally we had to wait it. There was a small mishap in the kitchen and they had to remake our food. They let us know the situation in a friendly manner. After trying the appetizer and the white pizza we decided it was worth the wait so we were patient. They gave us some zeppolis as compensation. Accidents happen, and they did a great job of making up for it! (10/10)\\n\\nThe Atmosphere:\\nLoved the music, they had oldies playing. The place was dimly lit and had an intimate feel. It was quiet and calm. You order at the front counter, but other than that it is a good sit-down place. (7/10)\",\n",

He was knowledgable about the menu and his recommendations were spot on to each of our tastes.\\n\\nWe started with the zucchini fritters. They were unique in that they had cheese inside but could have used a bit more seasoning--but nothing that the delicious aioli couldn't fix!\\n\\nFor my main I ordered the sweet potato tortelli. It was a dish that intrigued me from the menu and our server recommended it as well. It was good but in my opinion could have used sage to give the dish more flavor. My husband got the short ribs stew which he raved about. The cornbread that came with the stew was so good, not too dry and just enough kick from the peppers inside. \\n\\nWe finished with dessert which were perfectly portioned. We split the cheesecake which was to die for and the chocolate cake that was great as well.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Frankly, not sure what all the fuss is about.  It was fine; not great, not lousy, just fine.  We stopped in during happy hour before heading to the Giants/Dbacks opening game.  (Giants won, yay!)  The place was reasonably busy, but not crazy given that there were still a lot of empty tables.  We chose a number of items from the bar menu - pretzel rolls with cheese fondue, an antipasto plate, grilled mushrooms and marcona almonds.  The cheese fondue was about as bland as cheese can be and the pretzel rolls looked good, but were more bready than chewy like a pretzel should be and they pretty much tasted like pancakes.  The antipasto plate was a few slices of shaved salami, 2 small pieces of French bread and about a teaspoon of some kind of goat cheese.  This came with a small amount of house mustard and a cherry jam or chutney.  The plate was about 5 times too large for the small amount of stuff.  I don't know if they forgot something or this is just what they serve.  We ended up dumping the mustard in the fondue and that made it taste a lot better, so at least it served some purpose.  Maybe they should use this idea and do this, too?\\n\\nThe service was average at best.  We were seated quickly and our server, Tom, started out on a good note, but he was not in the picture much after we were served.  Our beers were long gone before he showed back up again, and the second round that we ordered was long in coming. The other tables near us seemed like they were having the same experience.  Don't know if this is the norm for their service.\\n\\nLike I said, nothing was horrible, nothing was great.  It was just OK.  This is probably a 2 to 2.5 star experience, but the Giants won so I'm rounding up.  Maybe we should have ordered a burger or something.  Who knows?\",\n",

I tried the halibut which was well prepared, my friends tried the bbq ribs and the steak and liked their entrees too.  The desserts were good too - warm choc cake, salted caramel pudding and the peanut butter.  Great location to stop before a DBacks or Suns game.',\n",

From fruit to chocolate and peanut butter, just pick one!  The fact that you can go to a restaurant and not ask your server if what you order is vegetarian friendly is a dream come true!  I go to Green when I am craving vegetarian comfort food.  The spicy buffalo wings and vegan chili fries are a good way to kick that craving.   The no harm chicken parm sandwich is so tasty but watch out it is messy!  If you want something a little healthier I recommend one of the bowls or a salad of course.  Either way in my opinion you won't go wrong with whatever you try.  Vegetarian food has come a long way and I couldn't be happier to have so many options!!!\",\n",

It had okay food and service, and the atmosphere was pretty nice for a relaxed business meeting. Elements of our experience, however, were very strange.  \\n\\nWe stared with cocktails & oysters, which were great.  When it came time for entrees, things got weird.  The waitress kept telling us the dishes we were considering when ordering were \"mediocre\", or \"not the best I\\'ve had\", or \"only okay\".  \\n\\nOur meals- the salmon, the scallops, and a kale salad with chicken- turned out okay, but the overall experience left something to be desired.

I had a half grilled veggie sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. The sandwich was very tasty; bread was perfectly toasted, veggies were cooked and seasoned well, and it had the proper amount of cheese. But the star of my meal was the mac and cheese. I tried to eat it slowly to savor every last bite. Easily the best mac and cheese that I've ever tasted. The one drawback was between waiting in line and waiting for the food it was a long lunch, but the food was well worth it. Fantastic.\",\n",

The posted menu was super confusing, when I finally got the hang of it I ordered a green chicken enchilada and a short rib enchilada. I added my sauces, some toppings, sat down. Not very much space in the resturant. The decor is okay, although I'm the type of person who would sit on the floor and look at blank walls if the food was outstanding...this was not! CUMIN does not equal Mexican. Both the sauces I got on my enchilads were overly spiced with cumin aswell as the both meats so it was CUMIN overload...I was no impressed to say the least.

Fresh wasabi was added on top of the nigiri. If you want additional fresh wasabi, they will charge you an extra $2.00 for \"real wasabi\". I was so bummed out because the other sushi place that I usually frequent gives out fresh wasabi FREE all the time. My favorite item on the menu was the H3 roll. It was spicy, but not in any way a tear-jerker kind of spicy. I would also recommend getting the spicy sashimi salad, which was super good with strong flavors of sesame oil. \\n\\nService was quick. We made a reservation, and were immediately seated upon arrival. The waitress forgot to bring out the miso soup we ordered until our meal was half done. By then, we had to cancel the soup from our order. \\n\\nThis place is right in Downtown Phoenix. They do not have a private parking lot.

That\\'s what we were there to try!\\nSo we stocked up on $1.00 tacos for lunch, right? Of course not, don\\'t be silly...dad was buying:)\\nWe had exactly 1 shredded beef taco (which was tasty, BTW). We had lobster tacos...(ok, but pretty salty...and if I think it was salty... baby, it was salty) we had veggie tacos, we had rice and beans. Most everything was OK to tasty and sent us off to the movies in fine style. \\nThe service was prompt and friendly, even though Cien Agaves was absolutely jam-packed during the lunch hour. I had no idea so many people wanted a full rack of $1.00 tacos!\\nNext time, I am going to see if I can eat $5.00 worth of Taco Tuesday tacos...I could do it when I was in the tequila club:)',\n",

       "  'text': \"I love this place. I've been coming here since the early 2000s. I can say that portion and quality has gone down. I can also say that depending on the time that you go the food can be terrible. This place has sort of become a gamble to go to. However, I still love their Jade Red Chicken and Jerk Fried Rice. Their refried beans are good as well and so are their quesadillas (quesadilla with Jerk or Jade Red chicken). Not everything on the menu is good, especially for me who loves seasoning. I would recommend to stay away from the Gringo Chicken and Emerald Chicken. I would recommend to try the Pollo Diablo or the Chinese Barbecue Pork on top of the Jade Red. Teriyaki chicken is not true Teriyaki (as is most American 'Teriyaki') as it is cut up unseasoned breast meat with sauce poured on top. Overall, for the items that I like solely, this place is four stars. Also, the snickerdoodle cookies are to die for, especially when they come out fresh and warm!\",\n",

All the tables were taken and the line was six deep.  The staff was extremely joyous and appeared to be enjoying the rush.  A staff member actually saved a table for us when one became available. The menu was easy to navigate and had something for everyone in my family. Previous reviews mentioned that the menu had lots  pork items, so we were prepared for slim pickings since were are a mostly vegetarian non pork eating (mainly personal reasons not religious) family.   However, there were plenty of items that fit the bill. My sons ordered and devoured the FIRST TIME (nutella, banana brulee) and the VANILLA BEAN CUSTARD with marinated strawberries and salted caramel.  My wife and I ordered the 13 MILE (Steadfast farm veggies plus French masala and buckweat crepes) and the BUCKWHEAT piquantee, mushroom ragout with horseradish havarti. The 13 Mile was surprisingly complex with French and South Indian flavors I certainly normally would not have made a crepe out of on my own, and the Buckwheat was savory, and had the right amount of cheese.  They brought out a granola sample that was light and house made with apricot slices ( fantastic) and also the House Brioche sampler which was too hard to eat-  about three times harder than an old crouton.  I am not sure what that was about.\\n\\nChecking in on Yelp earned us a free coffee or tea.  Its a big bummer they have no decaf coffee or espresso.',\n",

I'm not a fan of tequila, but if you are, this place is a must visit.  They have it all...\\n\\nAs for the food, I enjoy the fish tacos, as well as the baja lobster tacos.  Absolutely delicious!  I always tell myself I'm just getting 2 tacos, but end up getting 3 or sometimes, even four!  The guacamole is pretty good here as well. It always seems to sneak its way on our table as well.  \\n\\nAs for the service:  My fiance and I come here a lot, so we've had our share of good and bad servers.  Some are very friendly and are more than happy to please you, however, we've had a server or two who never checks up on you and takes 20 minutes to bring a beer even when its not busy.  Service is kind of hit-or-miss, but the food definitely makes up for it, and the prices are more than fair.\\n\\nWe've even used Cien Agaves to cater for a baby shower.  They allowed us to rent out the upstairs area.  It was out of the way and private, and the food was very satisfying.  They did a great job.\",\n",

I ordered my sushi and my drink and never saw the waitress again to fill my drink, nothing. I only finished 1/2 my 2 rolls which were terrible, paid my bill and left. There is FAR better quality Sushi in Phoenix. This place was just bad. Food, service, even the ambience lacked quality. Sorry people but this was terrible,  I would go somewhere else.

They set the tables in the back and the smaller children had the houses ready to decorate, while the older ones could build them from scratch.  Then they had a table set up with different candies and pretzels and a sample house so you can decide what to do with your house.  The event was amazingly cheap, it was only $10 per child and it included breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast and fruit.  The twins had a blast and enough candy to keep them wired for the rest of the day.  Thank goodness the nanny is coming later.',\n",

You're bound to get lucky, at the very least because positive karma will be catching up with you for not supporting any of the evil industries. \\n\\nOriginal review: \\n\\nI love this place. I went twice yesterday. I seriously cannot get enough. As a transitioning vegetarian/vegan, the food here is a dream come true. Everything I've had is amazing. Very tasty. The chocolate and organic peanut butter tsoynami is the best dessert I think I've ever had, vegan or not. But what the fuck is up with the temperature in that place? Vegans like a temperate place to eat as much as anyone. I can't eat in there. It's so hot. I have to get my food to go or only eat there in the winter. I just don't get it. Aren't the employees uncomfortable? How could I be the only one this bothers? That's a wrap is similarly uncomfortable, but more tolerable. All that complaining aside, I cannot recommend this place enough for the food. It's, quite frankly, delicious.\",\n",

Crêpe Bar's carte du jour manifests an aesthetic and novel approach to the French pancake classic commonly known as the crêpe. The crêperie-café ushers in sweet and stirring encounters, both culinary and social.\\n\\nOn that account, I turn the spotlight on to Shelby for the moment. Barista Shelby Moore serves up seasonally harvested Heart Coffee in baby blue and orangesicle- colored cups and suitably signs each brew with a heart. The Arizona native is a connoisseur of good food and surely good coffee; the French title gourmand describes him in every respect. Shelby's penchant for the culinary experience translates into effective editorial columns. The Class of 2014 scholar at ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication recently contributed to the March issue of Bite, a local food and drink magazine. \\n\\nEach meal on Crêpe Bar's menu brings into play the winning features of its cuisine. The crêperie's attention to texture is exemplified in each crunch and each chew; hints of masala and vanilla bean prove its palate full-flavored.\\n\\nI dedicated an hour to this hot spot with my friend Navi, indulging in a heart-to-heart over our jazzy cups of Heart Coffee. The window-side table for two provided a modest breeze and warm glow of sunshine.\",\n",

Add a really unique and thorough collection of gifts, wine, World Market-esque pantry items (Reminded me of a scaled down version of La Grande Orange's selection) and you get Tom's Thumb. The multi-use of gas station/restaurant may scare some people, but I'm from Kansas City, home of the worlds' most notorious BBQ/gas station combo so it ain't no thing.\\n\\nWe've exhausted pretty much all of the decent Scottsdale/North Scottsdale options and were wanting somewhere new-to-us. Enter going to Tom's Thumb on a whim. It's really convenient to us (just right right up the 101 a few minutes) and if every experience is like this weekend, we will be regulars in no time!\\n\\nThe decor in the restaurant seating area is so cute. A chalkboard drawing of a piggie (with various cuts, so mean), a gigantic, twinkling chandelier, a big row of BBQ sauces and condiments...even a doggie friendly patio! We picked up the menu (As the breakfast crowd got larger, servers began to bring people menus...it's seat yourself, at least for breakfast so pick a place you like!) and perused our options.\\n\\nEven though it's first and foremost a BBQ place, I found perfectly acceptable vegetarian-friendly items (or ones that could easily omit and ingredient to make it OK)...I went with a delicious breakfast sandwich that consisted of a whole wheat English muffin, an over easy egg (will get over hard next time--drippy goodness!), tomato, arugula and cheddar. So simple and perfect! Boyfriend went with a much more substantial and glorious option: Pigs and grits! Crispy pulled pork served over grits with crumbled jalapeno bacon and cheddar. Of course he added the egg option. He said it was outstanding. \\n\\nThe ONLY qualm I had was the servers seemed to get overwhelmed as more and more parties came in. Our food didn't take too long to come out, but several tables seemed to wait quite a long time and I overheard one server apologize profusely for it taking so long for him to take an order. I understand that breakfast can be really hard to predict (big rushes all at once, dead for a while, people chugging coffee and wanting 920 refills, etc.) I can definitely overlook this.\\n\\nI hope they liked our bright and shining faces, because we will be back!\",\n",

They are a larger place catering to an affluent crowd and serve what they described as California Mediterranean cuisine.  The lunch menu featured sandwiches, flat breads, salads and bruschettas and almost every table seemed to be enjoying a glass of wine with lunch.\\n\\nThe dress code seemed a bit fancy and I did feel a bit under dressed in my jeans but it didn't seem to affect our service.\\n\\nWe opted for the chicken chopped salad and got the half size at the recommendation of our fine server, which was still plenty big for lunch.  We also shared a cup (really a small bowl) of the daily soup special, beer cheese-thin but good.  Fresh focaccia and pesto also come with your meal and, we decided to join the crowd and have some wine too.\\n\\nService was attentive with water glasses kept full and the salads arrived without delay.  This place seems well run.  Hopefully on a future visit it would be warm enough to sit outside on their large shady patio.\\n\\nRecommended\",\n",

Basically after tax it is $7.50 for just 2 enchiladas and I would say it would take 3 enchiladas to be equal to a Chipotle burrito...maybe even 4. I just have a hard time spending $10-$11 for 2 enchiladas, chips and guac. So for me the food was really good but they need to make an order of enchiladas consist of 3 instead of 2 for the price they are charging.',\n",

In short, I'm disappointed with the service. The facility is cool and the food is actually really good. We reserved online and noted birthday as the occasion and asked for left-handed clubs. My mom wanted to bring a cake, but we were unable to reach anyone at the location (on hold 20 minutes and gave up). When we got there they said no. I told them it was my birthday and not only could I not bring in my cake, they didn't provide any dessert which was pretty weird to me. Also, we request left-handed clubs three times before we received them. Workers not very attentive, so don't expect anyone to go the extra mile for your special occasions.\",\n",

You can't beat the sweetness and perfectly fried taste of the Jade Red Chicken. The Pollo Diablo is a deliciously spicy and tangy combination of garlic, green onion, peppers, and spices with the most aromatic and crispy cornstarch fried chicken gems. The black beans are the best I have ever had, and they are perfectly smoothed out, accompanied by some gooey melted cheese on top! Do not leave without getting some of their amazing hot sauce!

Though, cutting it up into smaller portions seemed to work.\\n\\nThe cheesesteak was delicious, but the one-note, repetitive flavor became overwhelming towards the end.  I think it was the cheese they use.  It overpowers everything else and diminishes all of the other elements to an imperceptible degree.  I couldn't even taste the onions and green peppers.  The meat was also barely perceptible.  Too much cheese, I guess.\\n\\nThough, I did appreciate the fact that I could squish the cheesesteak without making a mess, which was the complete opposite of the meatball.\\n\\nOverall, Defalco's is still a great place, but personally I prefer Casella's.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Okay my wife and I visited last night sans kids for an adult dinner with drinks.  Started with an old fashioned which was pretty good even though I prefer mine a little less sweet.\\n\\nMy wife and I settled on oysters and shrimp for the starter.  The oysters were as fresh as if we were actually somewhere off the east coast where they came from off Long Island.  The giant prawn were great and meaty.  Fresh horse radish and separate cocktail sauce was nice but they added this third sauce that was supper tasty as well and I couldn't put my finger on it but it was delicious.\\n\\nFinally for dinner my wife chose the scallops and I chose the jambalaya.  My server helped me navigate as I couldn't decide between that and the braised short rib stew.  But since I told him I was starving and preferred a larger dish we went with it.  Next time I'll try the stew.  The scallops were perfect.  The server actually told us the chef vetoed the first batch as they were slightly over cooked which takes me to the three ***.  Before that my jambalaya was super flavorful.  He advised it was 8 of 10 on heat index and I would put it about 6 but I have higher tolerance than many.\\n\\nOkay the 3 stars is because it took sooooo long, 30 minutes, to get raw oysters and cold shrimp.  Granted the manager advised the seafood guy had to shuck 80 oysters.  Next it took forever to get the entrees which above I said the server advised that the scallops had to be redone.  This was what appeared to be an average Saturday night.  The wait was about 5 minutes although we had reservations.  \\n\\nLastly our server was top notch.  Knew the menu cold and had great descriptions about and opinions of every dish.  This guys has to be one of their best.\\n\\nI was a little disappointed when the restaurant forgave nearly half the menu of the couple next to us for their inconvenience but didn't even offer us a free dessert.  I guess not complaining and being pleasant has its limitations as it appeared the server and manager recognized the delayed service therefore no need to chatter about it or complain.  Squeaky wheel gets the grease!\\n\\nRegardless we will be back.  Great food,  good atmosphere and hopefully the kitchen will be more organized next time.\",\n",

The pretzels were fresh and somewhat rich . \\n\\nWe saw our order being ran out to another table , we knew it was ours and then we saw it go back to the open kitchen and a few minutes latter it came back to us and you enjoy your food slightly less when you see it sit in front of people you don't know . \\n\\nMy companion ordered the beef short rib stew with green chili's and corn bread . The stew with packed with big chunks of very tender tasty meat but instead of corn bread a tortilla was given . \\n\\nI had the chopped salmon salad and was surprised that the fish was a smoked fish and I think the menu should have said that and I do wonder if we didn't order the pretzel fondue if I would have received a roll or fancy cracker with my ($13) salad bread or cracker didn't come with it . \\n\\nMy salad was an Above Average Salad instead of the normal mix of greens the base of salad was marinated Kale and the other components of the salad were roasted cauliflower , currants and Marcona Almonds dressed perfect not too much . For my taste I would have preferred the cauliflower roasted crispy and maybe one other component to cut the rich fish and moist cauliflower . \\n\\napprox $45 (before tip) soda , ice tea pretzel fondue , beef stew , salad (lunch time)\",\n",

Our server was Sabrina who is seriously the prettiest thing ever. We got Frito Misto app (fried calamari, shrimp and zucchini. The portion was small and we only had like three zucc. My boyfriend got the scallops which he devoured. There were five huge scallops along with corn and asparagus. I got the chicken chopped salad which was also so good. The granola is an interesting touch but was pretty tasty (was hard to imagine granola in a salad when I ordered). It was rather inexpensive ($14) and was seriously huge (so much chicken, avocado, and goat cheese) I could only eat a thirdish of it. Can't wait to come back and get it again, I know I'll be craving it!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'We\\'re a group of healthcare professionals (NPs, PAs, and MDs) that meet every month to catch up and decompress from our crazy jobs; there\\'s about 8 of us. We arrived a bit early yesterday for happy hour, only to find that happy hour was cancelled due to the Rush concert at US Airways. Who cancels a published happy hour? So clearly, they just wanted to make more money off of the concertgoers with no regard to the typical customer. We ordered drinks for the lot, only to be asked every 20 seconds to get out of the way of the serving staff because the place was so packed and there was barely even standing room. There was no way to not be in the way. We got seated on the patio (because an inside table was a 2-hour wait) pretty quickly. However, the misters were broken at the table we were seated at - they worked fine at all of the other patio tables, but not ours. There didn\\'t seem to be any regard for the fact that it was 107°. We asked to be reseated, they said they couldn\\'t accommodate us anywhere else. We asked about a group of 2-tops that were available, were told they were reserved. I offered to sit at the table with the broken misters until something else opened up, but they said they didn\\'t know how long it\\'d be before another table opened up. We were pretty much ready to leave (I had said we\\'d just pick up some wine and go back to my place to make pizzas) when the \"reserved\" 2-tops suddenly became available and were rearranged to accommodate us. The server acted like we were a complete bother to him, like he\\'d rather be somewhere else with a different group of people. Really didn\\'t engage us very much. The appetizers were fantastic (shrimp and pretzels) and were gone in a heartbeat. Three of the eight of us ordered the prime rib. I joked that I didn\\'t even want mine cooked (i.e., as rare as possible), and the server told me it was already cooked and my request was not possible. I was kidding, of course, but it wasn\\'t received very well. When our food came, only one of us was given horseradish to accompany our prime rib. When I asked for horseradish for the other two, the server said, \"oh, you want more?\" No, I want SOME. I would say my prime rib was medium-rare at best. It was OK, pretty fatty, but that\\'s a risk you take with prime rib, I suppose. I was going to order another glass of wine, but I couldn\\'t get the attention of the server and he didn\\'t come back to the table to check up on us very frequently. When he brought me a to-go box, I had asked for more au jus and horseradish to-go, so he brought me an empty container to put my remnants in instead of fulfilling my request of new. We usually meet at 6:00 and don\\'t leave until about 9 or 10, usually sit around and have a few drinks while we chat. But this time, we all left by 8 and all went our separate ways. The consensus among the group was that we wouldn\\'t be back, individually or as a whole.\\n\\nI\\'ve been here before and enjoyed myself, but I really won\\'t be back after yesterday\\'s experience.\\n\\nUPDATE 9/7/2015: Chelsea, manager, messaged me for my phone number to talk about my experience. I sent it to her. Haven\\'t heard a word back. Moot point, really, as it doesn\\'t change my opinion about the place for better or worse. Just solidifies it.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I start this review during the long wait for my sandwich. So far my experience is negative. I knew exactly what I wanted though the cashier couldn\\'t get it right. When he asked if I wanted mayo, mustard or Italian dressing I replied Italian. Then when he said \"so you want everything\". I repeated no that I did not want mustard or mayo. At this point the guy in line though he would jump in and educate me on how to order a sandwich. I have some angry words that I am holding back from my review about this guy. I told him I knew what I was doing and he continued to mettle. I told him to stop. I finalized my order and was trying to pay when the cashier instead turned to ask the guy behind me what he wanted because he assumed we were together!!! 30 minutes wait and my sndwich arrives. The bread was delicious and all was fresh. Not enough cheese though. The menu should list that the sandwich I ordered is comprised of the spicey hot meat. It was not as I expected. The bread was yummy.  Overall though I have had better thus the two star rating.',\n",

If you are a fan of eggs benedict I would recommend this dish.  My husband had the Tocula pizza.  Which was very savory.  The menu indicated the pizza was spicy but the spice was more derived from the chorizo and a little kick of jalapeño.  Not as spicy as expected and very good.  On top of the delicious meal we recieved a frequent visitor card which gave us 10% off, which we can use on our future visits.  I'm not sure if everyone gets one of those cards or how it works.  Definitely try Scramble if you want Breakfast that is above ordinary.  We can't wait to go there again!\",\n",

When I first pulled up, the guy was polite and guided me through the process of selecting what j wanted to get.  It was his first day but he called over a guy to help answer a few questions, no biggie.  He was professional. I went inside the store front and got some bbq while I waited. The food was ok but was overpriced for what you got. There were a lot of cool nick knacks in the shop ranging from cards, to signs, to glassware, to books to clothing.  It seemed a little overwhelmed up front where the main cashier is also the one making the coffee drinks. The back seating area where I waited for my car was nice. I watched my car go through the tunnel on a video screen.  Overall, a cool vibe to the whole place.  Unlike any other car wash or gas station I've ever been to.

Well worth the wait to enjoy al fresco dining on a beautiful patio. I thought the menu items overall were a tad pricey. So I decided to order the Hummus ($6) as an appetizer and the Italian Flatbread ($12) as an entree.\\n\\nThe Hummus had tomatoes, onions and I believe cucumber (it was really dark outside so I'm not sure about the cucumber) on top of the Hummus. An excellent combination of flavors. The best Hummus I have ever had. The Italian Sausage and Goat Cheese Flatbread was serviceable but I can't see myself ever ordering that again. The Sausage had a little kick to it but really didn't taste too great.\\n\\nI'm a little fuzzy as to whether the bread that the server asked if we wanted was free. Why would you ask a diner if you wanted free bread? So that kind of rubbed me the wrong way since it seemed like some covert upselling to me. That's why we decided to order the Hummus instead of getting the bread. BTW - I only noticed one other table in our vicinty had the bread.\",\n",

In spite of this, management is doing a bad job at running the restaurant. They were out of half their tap beers as well as many of their bottled beers.  How does that happen?  I think alcohol and beer vendors deliver daily. I don't think I've ever seen that before other than maybe a backyard party at my buddy's. Service was extremely lackluster. Servers and food runners basically were doing us a favor by doing their job. Don't ask for a serving spoon to share a salad because if you do, they will give you stink eye, a deep sigh, and if you're lucky, give you a teaspoon.  The fish and chips were one level above Long John Silver. Actually LJS is better and their charcuterie is average at best with horrible presentation and delivery. The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that the beet salad was terrific!  Other than that I would avoid this place at all costs. Not worth the money and definitely not worth the aggravation of dealing with staff that have no interest in making the customer experience enjoyable.  Go to Hannys down the street instead.

We were done with our meal, enjoying some wine (good selection, by the way) and had some time to kill before the event we were going to was starting.

We had a free day and decided to make a reservation and try it since last year, with no reservation, we could not get in because it was such a busy popular place. Our wives have never touched a golf club in their lives and were content to just have some Bloody Mary's and watch us play but we convinced them, with the assistance of our waitress, to just have fun and enjoy the day. They were both beaming with smiles and laughs a plenty with in the first ten minutes of playing.\\nIt's like golf for obvious reasons, it's like darts because the targets have bulls eyes with an inner ring and outer rings and it's like bowling because you all take turns and compete individually or as teams.\\nOur waitress was amazing, after checking in, they text you which bay to report to and your waitress meets you there to get you checked in and give you a tutorial. She then takes your drink and food orders and then it becomes really fun. You rent the bay by the hour and you are prompted when your time is running out and you then have the option to play out your time or add more time. The girls who did not want to play at all then wanted to extend our time and before we knew it, we were there three hours.\\nFor the three hours, adult beverages and food for four, we were into it for about $200 for the entire group.\\nThere were people all around us of varying ages and abilities and they were all having a really good time. My wife was talking about how much fun she had all day and said she could not wait until Spring Training next year to do it again. They are building another facility over in Glendale, right on the other side of the freeway from the football stadium. We saw it under construction while driving back and forth to Spring Training games. So, I hope that relieves some of the popularity and will make it more receptive to walking in.\\nThis is a great activity to do with your entire family!\",\n",

The staff is very friendly, all healthy looking themselves, and they run an efficient ship. It's always a little busy when I go on the weekends, but it's never been an unreasonable wait.\",\n",

As I pulled into work today my gas light came on, and after all this rain we had my car was in desperate need of a wash. I prefer not to do these things after work to avoid the rush. Also, a lot of the car washes I've gone to lately haven't been cutting it. Tom's Thumb gave me the convenience of being able to fill up my tank, get my car washed and grab some delicious lunch in under an hour. \\n\\nNot only is this place time-saving, the things that they do, they do very well. My car was sparkling clean when I went to pick it up. They did a better job than I've seen in a very long time. So well, that I'm pretty sure I will only exclusively get it washed here. Off I went in my freshly cleaned car with my to-go sandwich and salad in hand. I ordered the half sandwich-half salad combo with smoked chicken salad. The chicken was delicious, flavorful and not disguised by a massive amount of mayo. The cranberry bread added some sweet to the savory chicken. My salad had fresh tomatoes, cojita cheese and a delicious balsamic vinaigrette. I really love this concept and it's great when they get everything right! After my great experience today, I'll be adding this into my lunch rotation.\",\n",

If I came back, I'd probably sit inside since the decor and ambiance inside seemed very special. \\n\\nFood: Zucchini Fritters - omg. AMAZING. Would definitely get again!! Beef Short Rib Stew - I think maybe this wasn't my cup of tea. I found it to be a little overly salted, and I forgot I don't love cornbread. I'd try something else next time around. \\nDrinks: Tried some of my friend's lavender drink and another friend's strawberry drink and both were good. Not overly sweet but not too dry either.\\n\\nService was SO sweet (including when I cut my finger under a table outside), but I found it to be just a tad slow.

One little thing though that's offputting is how they include the price of the game with any items your server brings out such as food and drinks as one bill, that percentage-wise, makes it seem that you need to tip more at the end. I mean, if it costs $35 to hit balls for an hour, and you order one $5 beer, you now owe more for the tip on that beer than the beer itself.  It seems like trickery to get the servers bigger tips. Not a fan of that method. Is that a little thing? I don't know, but I think I'll continue tipping on the service instead of the price to play regardless of how the bill is compiled.\",\n",

The rest of us came over in huge groups from the dinner and the staff was ready for us.\\n\\nUpstairs, we had two bartenders and the manager informed me that she had chips and salsa out for everyone to snack on...even though we just ate, everyone appreciated the thought and they were gobbled up!

Thank you guys so much for doing such a great job with our party!\\n\\nI had actually been here 3 years ago when I first moved and remember really enjoying the food as well, but the decor and service is what reminded me of how great this place is both for just hanging out and having a huge get together.

The sushi was amazing with just the right proportions of fillings to rice.

Although the price of my entree was ridiculous in my opinion ($26 for 3 shrimp atop risotto), everything else was excellent.  The bread and pesto they give you to start is phenomenal, the lamb meatballs are tender and delicious as was the tzatziki, and the shrimp and risotto was perfect as well.  The margherita flat bread was just ok and we should have opted for one not as basic.  Next time for sure.\\n\\nMy only advice is to either make a reservation or come early.  The place fills up fast around dinner time but 6:30 is a safe bet for early-birds without a reservation.  Also, the better the weather the more prime the real estate on the patio so get there super early to reserve your spot out there.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'First, it must be understood that this is a review for the Tempe location (which is pretty much in the southern tip of Scottsdale but that isn\\'t here and it isn\\'t there either) that has been newly remodeled. I will not speak in length of the old décor as it has no more relevance to the epitome of swank that is the new look at Green. I won\\'t talk about the recycled material art that lined the South wall that included lightly painted utensil drawer organizers and VW hubcaps. I also won\\'t talk about the slightly preachy overly optimistic quote that wrapped the wall through the corner near the restrooms written in a fun script only an undergrad girl studying design theory and armed with a paint brush could achieve. I also won\\'t mention the antique Piano up against the dividing wall that in spirit only begged one thing of whoever laid eyes on it, it\\'s modest demand was to be played in a manner worthy of the Saloons that once occupied the desert space where Green now lies, yet the only text on the instrument was a small sign written with a marker saying \" Please Do Not Play Piano\". I also won\\'t talk about the loooooong table going from front door to register that on busy nights you\\'d get stuck sitting at with two of your friends only to have your back brushed against by numerous vegetarian butts that graze only on accident and rarely warrant an apology but still. . . no buns on the back please.  \\nI will however mention their new patio that has arrived just in time for the cold season when dining on said patio will surely manifest in me a tension worthy of Hitchcock\\'s direction between enjoying sweater weather with solely my hot entrée or hitting the tipping point of finger numbing cold with my seemingly mandatory post-dinner Tsoynami. The caged in effect achieved by the patio might be resonant to that of a human cage, which to give credit to the designer might be the intent. The subtext of the patio may read something to the effect of Peter Signer\\'s breakthrough work, Animal Liberation, eliciting the contradictory feeling of being outside and feeling claustrophobic and caged in thus allowing the patron to empathize with the plight of factory farmed animals and subsequently prompting the euphoric smugness that comes from the knowledge that no animals were harmed or exploited in making that mock steak po\\'boy (except maybe the dudes in the kitchen scraping by for minimum wage*). The vintage car doors are still in effect over freshly vinyled booths that safely seat four, but typically six, partially due to their limited seating and mostly due to the nearly miniature size of the average patron who tend to be slight, frail and eager to show they don\\'t mind a little contact. \\nThe alternative girl vibe that exudes from the front of the house staff meshes well with the obvious southwestern conventionality of the kitchen staff. A \"powerclash\" in true form. If you disregard their post-Juno fashion choices you see some of the nicest, under-tipped, funny people in the local service industry. Calling in an order is as easy as vegan pie and pretty swift too. I\\'ve frequented this location for 5 years and don\\'t intend to stop anytime soon.

       "  'text': \"I don't get it. First time at the Arrogant Butcher and was not impressed. I feel like it's a trendier version of Chile's. I guess my mistake was ordering the scallops instead of something easier and more mainstream like pasta or a burger. I even asked about the scallops and how they were and waitress assured me they were great. They were nearly inedible and I only ate about half of a very tiny plate. They came with very old, wilted, yellowed parsley on top that I would've thrown away had it been in my fridge. The scallops came with bacon wrapped sweet potatoes which were SO SALTY and made the whole dish very unbalanced. It just is the wrong combination for scallops, and was a huge expensive fail. I probably should've sent it back, but I just wanted to get out of there and go home after a long week. \\n\\nI tasted my husband's fries and they were disgusting! They tasted stale and old, and just plain nasty. Probably the worst fries I've ever tasted. My daughter's mushroom pasta was very nice though, and I dipped my scallops into her leftover cream mushroom sauce so that I didn't leave hungry.\\n\\nThe Laguna Chardonnay was really nice though, and not sure I've had it before. Service was ok in terms of speed, but I didn't encounter anyone particularly friendly. Not rude, just not welcoming. \\n\\nWe were considering having a large company holiday event here, but it's off the list now as I would not trust the food quality.\",\n",

I am not vegan, but I have an egg allergy, which makes eating dessert hard sometimes :'(\\n\\nGreen holds a special place in my heart because it was the first place I ever ate dinner at in Arizona. When I moved to Arizona my mom (who also has an egg allergy) came out to look at apartments with me. We were staying around the corner at the Holiday Inn in Old Town, where they recommended we eat at Green for vegan food. We then returned every day for either lunch or dinner for the remainder of our trip. Once I arrived in Arizona I used to get Green at least once a week, generally as take out. Everything is delicious, not really super healthy for the most part but I can deal with that when I am eating vegan food sometimes! I also don't think that is the goal here, I believe Green is taking a vegan twist on comfort foods and they do it well. I used to get a Coffee Tsoynami and the Calexico Burger--so good, but you'll need a siesta afterwards.\\n\\nI personally prefer when not a lot of meat substitutes are used in vegan food, which is the only reason why I am giving Green 4 instead of 5 stars. Most dishes use a meat substitute like seitan or tofu, though I'm sure you can avoid this by ordering something else with beans for example. I feel sad I never went to Nami in my time out in Phoenix and when I visit next I will need to try their food out too in addition to returning to Green!\",\n",

The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, the selection at the deli and small grocery section is ample, the service is with a smile.\\n\\nHere are a few more reasons you should go here:\\n\\n~Large selection of dried pastas, imported food from Europe, and a selection of canned San Marzano tomatoes.\\n~Make a quick stop on the way home to pick up a tasty bakery treat and a cappuccino.\\n~Call ahead and order a pizza for takeout or calzone to fill your belly.\\n~Stop at the deli and pick up some fresh sliced Boar's Head meats & cheeses or some freshly made antipasti, green salad or even ravioli.\\n\\nYou can even take a moment and eat in the restaurant or on the patio. As others have mentioned here, there're many wonderful things on the menu, but I will have to agree that the Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich is absolutely wonderful and perhaps one of the best you will find; as is the Sausage Sandwich and Meatball.  Choose your bread wisely though as some are choices are better than others for the substantial filling within the bread.\\n\\nOverall Score:  4.8 Stars\\nFood: 4.8 Stars\\nService: 4.4 Stars\\nQuality: 4.7 Stars\\nCleanliness: 4 Stars\\nValue: 4 Stars\",\n",

The grilled asparagus were great--again, very \"bold\" flavor with olive oil and vinegar.  Lastly, the soft pretzel bites and provolone fondue were outstanding!

I was asking them to take over $500.00 of my money and was told no...      \\n                                                                                                               \\n  So I called DeFalco\\'s and they were super accommodating, the manager Robert was professional, honest with the amount of portions we needed and eager to help a guest who wanted to give them business. We ordered a 6 foot Italian sub, a 5 foot veggie sub, two lasagna; one traditional and one vegetarian. The only thing about this experience that was better than Robert\\'s helpful attitude, was the mouthwatering, hundred mile food(worth driving a hundred miles to eat it) they provided!!!\\n\\nWell done team Defalco\\'s you are an example for the misguided restaurant that puts more effort into policy than serving the guest!!!\\nI recommend this restaurant for any of your dining needs!!! \\n\\nWell done.\\nCFC',\n",

However we asked for a box and we're clearly finished eating and after about 10 min we finally asked for the check. (It was not busy and the waiter walked by several times already) he came back with the check, and walked away for about another 10 minutes. Lol.

Alex came over set everything up for us, was very patient, friendly and was always around when we need him. He even kept the ice packs my brother needed for his back in a freezer and switched them out as needed. We started with one hour and we were hooked immediately. Before we knew it we had been there for 3.5 hours. The environment, the food and beer were all great. They have found a way to make a driving range fun not just for golfers but for anyone!

The atmosphere here is contagiously fun and with the skulls everywhere and mexican decor adding to the vibe, I felt I had been transported to Mexico minus being frisked by the border patrol.\\n\\nThe shrimp taco was full of zesty full-sized shrimps and was spicy. The shredded beef taco and the chicken one didn't disappoint either. Best of all the shells were fried and crunchy which added to the zesty tasty explosion going on in my mouth!

       "  'text': \"Went here for my birthday last night. I love the atmosphere but the food ... I'm on the fence. We started off with the fritto misto. Very soft, tender, not too breaded. I think that might be my fav so far. For entrees, we had the bouillabaisse, bone-in ribeye, and lasagna. The bouillabaisse was okay. My friends liked it. The broth lost flavor when dipped with bread. The lasagna is just lasagna and how can you go wrong? Lastly, the bone-in ribeye. Now, I'm the type of girl who an eat steak everyday, or every other day. I have eaten steak for 7 days straight. That's how much I love steak, and bone-in....yes! After having a bone-in ribeye at Steak 44 last week, I couldn't wait to eat another. By all means, I'm not comparing. But the creamed spinach was so rich that it took over the flavor and there was no steak to taste. Totally disappointing. If I were to order the steak again, I would ask to substitute the creamed spinach and not have any foods touch my steak. Also, it seemed like the chef really likes butter. I mean, probably not the healthiest dishes. I would come back but not order the same dishes. I'll keep you updated along the way....\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I feel like I've worn out my barbecue disclaimer at this point, but as today was my first trip to the The Thumb, its nevertheless important for me to put this out there.  Little Miss BBQ has likely ruined me for most (if not all) other barbecue joints in the valley metro area.  There are plenty of decent serviceable barbecue spots all over town.  But in terms of meat quality Little Miss is still king by a landslide.  Now, that doesn't mean other barbecue in the valley isn't worth exploring, nor does it mean all joints have the same personality.  And The Thumb most definitely has a personality all its own.  A gas station, a car wash, a gift shop, a wine cellar, a bakery, & oh yeah, a barbecue restaurant.  I had heard of (but hadn't seen) their Diners Drive-Ins & Dives appearance awhile back & had read mostly positive reviews, so Saturday at lunch seemed as good a time as any to make my first appearance.\\n\\nYou'll find this multifaceted business located on the southwest corner of 94th Street & Bell in north Scottsdale.  From the outside, the place looks like your standard gas station & car wash.  Inside, its a whole different story.  Walk in through the north building entrance & you're immediately greeted by a neon sign, a big barbecue & bakery counter, segmented restaurant & picnic style seating, a travel station style gift shop & a surprisingly impressive collection of fine wines for sale.  Including seating on the patio outside, I'd guess they can pack in at least 100 at full capacity.\\n\\nFor me, the visit today was all about the barbecue.  To my surprise however, The Thumb is the first barbecue joint I've been to that has barbecue breakfast items.  As they only serve those until 11am I just missed last call on that, but perhaps next time I might explore that further.  For my first go around, I was looking for something of a sampler platter so as to try as much of The Thumb's menu as possible.  The 3 Meat Platter seemed to fit the billing.  Three meats, cornbread, pickles, onions, & your choice of two sides.  For my three meats I went brisket, pulled pork, & pulled chicken.  For the two sides, it was their BBQ beans, & baked mac & cheese.  Here you order at the register & grab a number for your table.  As they were pretty busy, they warned me in advance my food would take about 15 minutes to come out.  So I grabbed a spot & waited.  The Thumb's general manager Mike Lawson actually came by my table while I waited & kindly asked if he could help make my experience 5 star that day.  I thanked him for asking but told him I'd let the product speak for itself once it arrived.\\n\\nOnce the food arrived, I was ready to dig in.  For the record, I ordered the fatty brisket versus the lean (because are we really counting calories here?).  Honestly, the brisket was so-so.  I know, its pretty much impossible to top Little Miss & the meat was okay, but it came out a bit too dry.  It needed some sauce to give it some life.  Fortunately The Thumb does have an excellent house BBQ sauce with just a little heat to give the meat a pick me up.  The pulled pork was juicer & did a better job standing on its own, but was also largely improved by the sauce.  The pulled chicken on the other hand was quite impressive.  Great chunks of juicy smoked meat that didn't need sauce at all to make for a satisfying dish.  I was also very impressed with my two side dishes.  The beans in particular were bursting with different flavors & their baked mac & cheese was super rich & creamy.  Both made for a great smoothing contrast with the meats.  The cornbread on the other hand was pretty forgetful.  I like cornbread to have a bit of a moist texture to go with its crumbly disposition.  This one was really dry & had the texture of raw cornmeal moreso than bread.\\n\\nI noticed the restaurant was also offering a special dessert for Girl Scout Cookie season called a S'mores Pop.  It was a dark chocolate cube on a stick.  Inside said cube were layers of fudge brownie, chocolate marshmallow, and s'mores cookie crust.  So I walked up to the bakery counter and grabbed one of those for dessert.  A pretty satisfying finish if you're a chocolate fan (and I am) with four different types of chocolate influences working in harmony.  And proceeds from the sale benefited the local Girl Scouts, so that's always a plus.\\n\\nTotal cost for the food, glass of water, and tax came to about $27.  The traditional barbecue mainstays like brisket & pulled pork left much to me desired for me.  But the sides, the pulled chicken, and dessert were solid.  No compliants about the service I received here as the staff is super friendly.  I will give this place another try at some point during breakfast as that has my curiosity.  But in the big picture, Scott Holmes still rules the barbecue genre in this town.  Kipp Lassetter has an intriguing thing going here at the The Thumb, but there's room to improve & hopefully someday earn that 5 star rating they kindly asked of me.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I was honestly blown away with the many flavors I experienced  here. First there was the freshly baked bread and pesto dipping sauce. By far the most flavorful pesto dipping sauce I've ever tasted. The bread melts in your mouth and the garlic pesto pairing is to die for. Then there was the spicy shrimp risotto and bone in ribeye that my wife and I shared. I'll start with the risotto. Flavor A+ however the consistency of the risotto was B-. It was a tad bit runny, but I still would highly recommend it as it was still a stellar dish. The ribeye, on the other hand, A++. I ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection. Honestly I would recommend having the risotto as a side option. Lastly, the service was great and the drinks were great. Over all experience excellent.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Ambiance:\\nThis restaurant was featured on Diners, Dives and Drive-ins. Chino Bandido is the very definition of dive.  \\n\\nService:\\nPleasant and fast. Some staffs were friendlier than the other. Unfortunately for us, we got the other.\\n\\nFood:\\nBecause of all the food trucks in LA and OC, I knew that Mexican and Asian combo is a winner. While the dishes I've tried in Socal are Mexican and Asian cuisines fused together to create a dish, at Chino Bandido, Mexican and Asian dishes are separate but are served together. \\n\\nAfter sampling several items, I decided to get Jerk Fried Rice bowl with Jade Red Chicken. Jade Red Chicken was quite similar to but definitely more flavorful than Orange Chicken. Jerk Fried Rice on the other hand, is basically a Chinese-style fried rice with small cubes of jerk chicken. The smokiness and spiciness from jerk chicken went really well the sweeter Jade Red Chicken. \\n\\nCost Performance:\\nThe cost was under $7 excluding tip. Considering the serving portion (while not generous, it was more than enough for a person with average appetite) and the quality of the food, the cost performance is pretty good.\",\n",

So where do I start? I normally stick to one or two things on the menu at most restaurants, but this place has so many good ones I bounce around. First, salads - I\\'m currently obsessed with the Spicy Peanut \"chicken\" salad, but also love the Green salad..simple light and tasty.  Sandwiches - Spicy Po Boy....love it.  Bowls - Kung Pao is my favorite. I also like the spicy peanut bowl.  They are actually both very similar though so either is great. Pizza - the Western..delish! And probably the best part of Green....the Soynami. I\\'ve had several and all are amazing and better than any other soft serve option I was throwing down my gullet before I began Vegan. Sometimes they even have a wedding cake soynami.  If you ever see this on the menu get it! Oh and how could I forget the apps....hummus and \"wings\" are my favorite. This place is very reasonably priced too.  We can get an app, two meals, and a soynami for about $25 bucks.\\n\\nThe staff is always super nice and friendly. Service is always fast too. The atmosphere is pretty funky and cool although you might not see this from the outside. Just go inside - you\\'ll be fine.\\n\\nWe\\'ve also been there for 4th of July and Thanksgiving and both were awesome. Everyone thinks vegans eat badly at Thanksgiving with no dead bird and all, but I couldn\\'t imagine anyone not loving Green\\'s Thanksgiving meals. \\n\\nGo there and enjoy!',\n",

       "  'text': \"Having lived out on the East Coast for 7 years and frequenting the city almost every weekend, I was in the mood for a NYC 'street corner' slice.  Searched around Yelp and this place obviously caught my eye, by both the ratings and the vicinity to my house.\\n\\nJust like a couple of other reviewers on here, I walked in and was immediately greeted by Tony.  He introduced himself and asked me if it was my first time there. After placing my to go order (plain cheese pie...my standard when sizing a pizza place up), he hooked me up with a free order of garlic knots while waiting for my pizza.  They were awesome...super garlicky and soft.  I skipped the provided tomato sauce because they were so good on their own.  Waited a couple of more minutes and Tony hooked me up with a bad of Zeppole!  Didn't eat them there, but had them at home after the pizza and they were a perfect end to my meal.\\n\\nTo the pizza...15 minutes later and I was heading out with my pie.  The aroma alone was intoxicating on the drive home.  TOTALLY reminding me of my time spent in the city.  Got home, opened up the box and wasted no time on my first slice...it was all that I missed about NYC pizza.  Thin, chewy crust that actually has great flavor on its own, good quality and perfectly greasy cheese and a light but well seasoned and tangy sauce.  The ONLY thing that I would've changed is that I tend to like my crust a little more well done...I don't mind a little burnt crust on the bottom and edges.  I noticed that outside of NYC, pizza places that are ''NY style'' tend to show a little restraint in this respect, probably because people not used to it might complain that their pizza is burnt. (I don't really know if I'm right, but I'm guessing because I noticed this at Grimaldis).  Easy fix...just order it ''well done'' next time.  Based on my experience with the guys working there, they'd be more than happy to accommodate.\\n\\nAnyway, all in all a great pie and GREAT people/service...it definitely satisfied my craving.  As a self proclaimed pizza fanatic (I'm on Serious Eats pizza blog, Slice, daily), all those fancy wood-fired pizza places (a la Bianco and kin) are great, but when I want that NYC pizza that I often crave, these guys will be getting my business every time.\\n\\nThey also have a pretty decent pasta and hoagie selection...might have to hit those up next time.  Thanks again guys.\\n\\n(sorry this was a bit long)\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I really want to like this place. It is only a 10 minute walk from my house, and it is very convenient for me. I have eaten her several times, and have had a few things off of the menu. I highly recommend the brizzas, breakfast pizzas. They are delicious and they are always good. The other items that I have tried have been hit or miss. \\n\\nThe Gouda brizza is made with smoked gouda and apple smoked bacon. What can be wrong with that combo? Absolutely nothing! I have also had The Toluca. It has chorizo, peppers, cheese, and jalapeno cream cheese. This brizza is so good, but very rich. \\n\\nI have also had the three cheese omelet. The first time I had it the omelet, it was brown, dry, and inedible. I sent it back and the replacement was excellent. The truth is the rosemary potatoes were the best thing about the meal. \\n\\nThis morning I work up with a craving for pancakes. So, I ordered the multigrain pancakes. When they arrived they looked great. However, when I took my first bite I was so disappointed. I went back and looked at the menu, and there was no mention that these were cinnamon pancakes. There was so much cinnamon in these pancakes that they were nearly inedible. Imagine chewing 2 sticks of Big Red chewning gum and taking a bite of pancake. That is what it tasted like. The cinnamon taste actually took my breath away. I couldn't finish them. They left a horrible after taste in my mouth. I love cinnamon, but just not in my pancakes. If I had known that these were cinnamon pancakes, I wouldn't have ordered them. \\n\\nI am sure that I will go back to Scramble, but I am pretty sure I will not order the pancakes again. They should really revise the menu to mention that these are cinnamon pancakes.\",\n",

The atmosphere is trendy, it has a very hipster \"vibe\" going on and the staff was overall friendly and helpful. \\n\\nNow about the food. I ordered the Big WAC, which was surprisingly delicious, although a bit greasy (kept dripping in the basket). The thyme fries were good. My husband had the BBQ burger, which he said tasted like cardboard with a layer of sauce which made it...in his words \"edible\". He made a good point that without the \"special sauce\" mine probably would\\'ve tasted pretty bland too. My little one had the kids \"burger\" and fries. He didn\\'t realize it wasn\\'t real meat, so that was good :) My other one wasn\\'t as adventurous and just wanted a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette. I happened to notice on the receipt they upcharged us 50 cents to add cucumber (really, $6.50 for lettuce, cucumber and dressing?). Anyways. Kids wanted a chocolate chip cookie for $2 each, which they both said tasted good but a bit dry. I ordered the Banana Cream pie Tsoynami, which I highly recommend. It was huge so you may want to share it. I may have to stop back for another if I\\'m in the area sometime, but I highly doubt we\\'re going back for the food anytime soon.',\n",

What I love about this place is that it's unique in that their sushi is made with purple or forbidden rice. So it's better than white rice, and brown rice too. It's pretty much a sushi resto with exceptions during the weekday lunch hour where they also serve bento boxes. The seafood is fresh, good eats, and a great experience!\",\n",

Too bad we didn't get one.   \\n\\nOn the plus side, their breads are all delicious, the grocery store is awesome, the wines extensive and inexpensive, and the seafood salad is the shiznit! Overall, a solid 3 stars.\\n\\nWe've learned our lesson.  Next time we go,  We're getting 2 glasses of wine, 2 orders of seafood salad, splitting one of their COLD SUBS, and getting a regular cannoli.\\nBTW:  I almost forgot.  We do love their garlic bread.  :)\\n\\nUPDATE: The owner sent me an extremely polite e-mail.  We have decided to give the eggplant parm another try on another day and I will bring my mom.  She is an eggplant fanatic and eggplant parm may be her favorite food.  We will update y'all when we go.\",\n",

I've seen cien agaves on my yelp a few times so after the crushbrew fest this spot was walking distance I figured it was the right time. The place is small and super cool with all the decorations and paintings on the walls it definitely catches your eyes so I was stoked to try the food and drinks. The salsas are bomb specially the Red ill give that 5 stars. The food I was disappointed big time. The carnitas were dry and were not carnitas they were more of a machaca dried shredded beef and was way salty. The beans and rice were ok. The drinks again disappointed the margaritas were very sour and watered down,no wayyyyy these are the best or even close. The service was good, amy was friendly and did a great job but, food wise and drinks they were below standards. I think just because they are in old town they have a good rep but there's a lot better and more authentic Mexican food and drinks in 90 percent of phx or scottsdale and cheaper. A lot of hype and not enough substance.\",\n",

Arrogant Butcher was only a few blocks from our hotel, but we decided to drive since we were headed to the airport after wards.  It was extremely difficult getting there by car.  The roads were blocked and major construction was all around the restaurant.  Whew! We finally were able to park in the deck!  The restaurant did validate our parking, so that was a relief. The restaurant was packed, but our wait was only 10 minutes.  We started our meal with hummus, artichokes and sweet red peppers.  We added roasted elephant garlic as a side.  It was yummy...and the bread with the appetizer was pretzel bread.  My friend ordered the Turkey Sloppy Joe and I ordered the Turkey Pastrami.  Both sandwiches were on a pretzel bun.  Both sandwiches were yummy and I would order again in a heart beat!  Turkey can be dry, but mine was the right amount of juice with a great spicy flavor. Nice way to finish my trip to downtown Phoenix, but not sure if it's worth the trip if you're not already in the area.\",\n",

The atmosphere was fun and lively. The only things that I was not thrilled about is the seating. Basically you have to run to an empty table, bus it yourself, and if the table isn't empty you have to intrude on people that are getting ready to leave. I don't mind asking people if they are done with their meal but I felt a little awkward doing it, like I was rushing them..... The other negative is the way that the staff screams your name when your food is up. I think if they implemented a number system the whole place would function more efficiently. Overall, the experience was pleasant, the food was great, and the prices were reasonable. I will definitely be going back.\",\n",

BUT ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago, i've had nearly everything on the menu. and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything.\\n\\nmy favorites: number one absolutely has to be the mexi-cali burger. i could eat these everyday. it has the flame-broiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat, but don't let it freak you out. it also comes with hummus, bright orange nacho cheese, and chipotle sauce. this burger is SPIIICCYYYY so beware. their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned. also love their soy ice cream treats, soy-namis, my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch. their lime-ade, lemon-ade, and teas are always fresh and delicious. i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicy-lovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant (yummmm) and tomatos. \\n\\ntheir pita chips and hummus are to die for. they're crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus. and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing.\\n\\ngreen nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"This establishment I believe started out of a catering truck which is pretty impressive. I found this restaurant searching yelp and decided to give it a try do to it's overwhelming rave reviews. It's a bit too small of a place for my taste accommodation wise. I like a little room while I am eating. The lighting is very dim and not very good for a restaurant. Kind of feels like you're in a dark cave. It was a Saturday morning so you can expect a wait time, which ours was about 30 minutes before our food arrived. Unfortunately, mine came with it really long piece of hair all curled up on the very top of it. The server took it back and brought me a new meal in a couple minutes just as the rest of our order was ready. Besides all the lack of attraction to this place & my mystery topping I quite enjoyed my meal. We had ordered 2 breakfast burritos, 2 egg and cheese crêpes and some nutella crêpes with bananas. The breakfast burritos and the chocolate banana crêpes were quite impressive. The egg and cheese crêpes were a bit greasy and also had a bit of spice to them. Being that we had typical kids with us, it's hard to find something on the menu that would satisfy picky plain children so if you have these you might want to consider feeding them before or go for the gusto and give them a sugar rush of chocolate. All in all, I really did enjoy the food. I think this place is best if kept for people with a flair for food but probably not children. I will return and flavor this place again but with out the kids\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Italian is not my #1 choice but my husband has picked Deflaco\\'s for dinner twice in two weeks! We were so pleased after our first visit that we went back not too much after. This place is great in that they have made-to-order sandwiches, pastas, and pizzas and also a wide selection of groceries.\\n\\nThe first time we went was on a Friday night & it was packed! Even though the line was long, the time it took to order & also get our food was reasonable. I decided to get the Grilled Veggie Sandwich & Penne/Mostaccioli side salad and my husband got the Calzone & Tortellini Salad side salad. The sandwich & side salads were both very colorful and tasted great.\\n\\nI think the sandwich would have benefited from having the herbed mayonnaise inside the sandwich instead of on the top to really get the flavor of it on the veggies. I honestly should have just asked for an extra side of it since I always like there to be a generous amount of spread / sauce but still, I enjoyed it.\\n\\nI was a bit hesitant in ordering the Penne side salad because it had salami & pepperoni. The meats didn\\'t have a strong flavor though, so I wasn\\'t even able to tell that the pasta salad had any meat in it (until I ate the pieces of salami & pepperoni), very good! The tortellini side salad was equally good, and in this one as well, the ham didn\\'t have a super strong flavor. I\\'d recommend either one but if I had to pick, I\\'d go with the tortellini.\\n\\nMy husband enjoyed his calzone so much that he got it both times we were there. The first time, he got a 10\" one with mushrooms and the second time, he got the 12\" one with sausage & mushrooms. The calzone was was really cheesy and had quite a bit of toppings. The best part though (in my opinion) was the marinara sauce that came with it. So good!\\n\\nI had gotten the Margarita Pizza the second time & even the 12\" was huge, I was literally able to get three meals out of it. I enjoyed the flavors that were on it but this wouldn\\'t be my number 1 place to get a pizza at ... yet. I am interested in trying out just a cheese pizza with toppings & the White Pizza too.\\n\\nOverall, 4.5 stars for flavors, ease of ordering, & the good service (especially considering it\\'s a grocery store). We saw them bring out fettuccini alfredo & lasagna to other tables & they looked amazing. I can\\'t wait to go back & try their other menu options.',\n",

       "  'text': 'What do you do when you only have one evening, basically enough time for dinner and drinks in Phoenix before taking off for an early morning flight? You make the best of your first time in town and scroll through Yelp to help you find good food and drinks!\\n\\nHubby and I are notorious \"small plates/tapas kind-a-people\" so when I came across this place I could tell from looking at the pictures, this place would be right up our alley. The place is huge so take your pick! We chose to belly up to the bar and start the night off with a few cocktails. And, seriously, what\\'s more fun than getting served by a Jake Gyllenhaal\\'s doppelganger?? Okay, I\\'ll admit it was more fun for me, than for hubby, but he couldn\\'t deny this guy was his identical twin separated at birth. \\n\\nWe decided on ordering a charcuterie board (aka Butcher\\'s platter $24) because that\\'s our jam. It was the chef\\'s daily favorites and while it was different, it was good minus the blue cheese.We enjoyed the spin on it with the deviled eggs, corn cake muffins, pistachios, and bacon wrapped sweet potato bites. \\n\\nThe cocktails we had were all very good. Prices ranged from $11-12 bucks which is about average for hand crafted drinks. They also have a variety of beers on tap as well as bottle/canned beer too.  The rest of the menu looked appetizing as well with dishes ranging from meatloaf, salads, stews, fish, burgers and a raw bar too! \\n\\nOverall, who wouldn\\'t like sitting in a hipster bar being served cocktails and appetizers by Jake Gyllenhaal? Ok, well don\\'t ask my husband, but take it from me, I\\'d definitely go back if in Phoenix again and well, of course try more of their dishes and (probably) sit in the dining area! No, just kidding of course at the bar!',\n",

You have specials that change all of the time! I just wish you would make about 90% of these specials permanent menu items! I love some of them so much it depresses me when they run out or are no longer available. Example, the Chicken Schwarma wrap. I would KILL for that to be on the menu. It is my favorite thing ever. \\n\\n5. Most of your staff are some of the coolest people ever, and always remember us. Its nice when staff remember you (and your favorite specials). It also helps that my husband and I have been here at least 50 times in the last year. \\n\\n6. You don't just make me choose from a few measly salads. You have sandwiches, pizza, pasta, bowls, appetizers. The BBQ chicken and the Mexicali burgers are the greatest things ever. \\n\\n7. You are relatively close to my house, and I don't have to trek 30 miles to get there. So if at 8pm I decide I want you, I can get to you and not have to worry about making it before you close. \\n\\n8. You have an in store market where if I feel the need to pick up a box of vegan mac and cheese, I can. \\n\\nThere are tons of reasons to eat here, whether you are vegan or not. You have to try this place. It is amazing and no matter what you get off the menu, you will not be disappointed.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"First off, first impressions are important and The Arrogant Butcher failed to make a good first impression. We had a 5:00pm reservation but were greeted, actually not greeted at all, by two very young girls who seemed to know little about hostessing. \\n\\nOnce seated, the atmosphere was pretty cool and we were given water right away which was appreciated.  The menu had some good options and we decided to go with the zucchini fritters, short rib stew, and the sea bass.\\n\\nZucchini fritters: light, fluffy, a perfect sized appetizer for sharing but very underseasoned. The aioli, however, was very tasty. \\n\\nShort rib stew and corn bread muffin: amazing! Live up to the hype! Well done! The meat melts in your mouth and there was just the right amount of spice. The cornbread muffin was fresh, sweet, crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside. Yum!\\n\\n\\nSea bass: This is the meal that I personally ended up with and it was terrible. I would've preferred a bowl of  just the barely because the fish was dry and flavorless. Horrible dish. The menu says it has artichokes but fails to mention that there are two paper thin slivers of artichokes! The barely was decent, under seasoned, but decent. I would never order this again. Worst sea bass I have ever eaten in my life. Might as well throw a fish stick on the top of this dish. \\n\\n\\nService: It was just okay. The kid disappeared constantly and took quite a while to return but his colleagues picked up the slack. Service was very average.\\n\\nWe may return but we'd be more specific in the reservation and steer clear of that sea bass. Bleh!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Let me start by saying that we love Topgolf! Good drinks, decent food and overall a good time. Being from Seattle WA, we don't have anything like this back home and make a point to include Topgolf into our Arizona vacations, atleast once a year. This time though, we came in on a Saturday afternoon with our family and were expecting it to be busy. We were quoted a two and half hour wait time; long, but considered well worth it to us. We decided to sit in the bar and enjoy appetizers and drinks while we waited to golf. When we were reaching our quoted time, we went to the front to ask about how much longer we could expect. The person working informed us that their systems had been down that day causing longer delays and that it was going to be about another hour and half on top of the two and half hours we already waited! Being highly disappointed, we decided to leave. We understand that stuff happens, but they should've let us know about the system delays and extra long wait times upfront so we could've decided to go else where instead of wasting one of our vacation nights waiting for nothing. We could've spent our waiting time driving to the other location if we knew it was going to be THAT long. Like I said, we only make it down here a couple times a year and look forward to visiting Topgolf everytime. Between the 7 of us, we spend atleast $300+ each visit. We were so disappointed I don't know if we'll waste our time coming back. Topgolf is fun, but not worth having to wait 3-4 hours, especially when we're here out of town for only 3 nights. You can have wings and beer anywhere!\",\n",

They had tables open on the patio but nothing for inside for another hour and half.

There was also a nice breeze that day that helped. Service was good the waitress checked up on a few times and kept our waters refilled. They also allowed us to bring in our outside drinks. We had stopped by a coffee shop before heading over. Their brunch menu consisted of lunch and breakfast items. I opted for the tuna salad sandwich, with apple, celery, baby greens on toasted wheat bread. Tuna salad was good it was not overly dressed with mayo. I chose a side of fries to go with it. We also had their lamb gyro with grilled pita. It was a little disappointing they used a lamb patty. We were expecting slices of lamb meat. The pita tasted more like a tortilla.

So dreamy.\\n\\nThat\\'s all you really  need to know, but I\\'ll humor you since you\\'re reading reviews for a reason, hm? \\n\\nBruschetta sampler: Prosciutto/fig, Manchego/chorizo, Apple/Brie\\nAll of them were delicious, though the prosciutto one was hard to eat due to the meat not having been cut...the bread was cut into thirds prior to the meat being added so we had to remove all the arugula and cut the meat, then re-build the app. That was weird. But the flavor was A+\\n\\nWe drank the white wine sangria, which packs a punch thanks to the brandy, and the cactus blossom cocktail. Both were great on a warm summer evening. \\n\\nSeabass: though I did enjoy it, I wouldn\\'t order it again. It was well prepared but I prefer fish without the gray meat as it tastes a little gamey...Again, just my preference. The sides it came with were small, but good. The few pieces of \"caramelized\" cauliflower left something to be desired as it was closer to just roasted cauli, but the candied grapefruit and snap peas were perfect with the mild white fish. \\n\\nFilet Mignon: served with horseradish potatoes & red wine shallots--stole the show, without a doubt. Nothing to complain about here. My husband ordered it rare, and it came out with a lovely charred crust and warm red center. Beautiful. Plate envy for sure.\\n\\nCheesecake w/ stewed peaches: Decadent and delicious, and certainly enough for two after all the food we\\'d already had. \\n\\nRoll me out and valet the car, dear.

The outside tables look a little difficult to eat at, so we were glad we were  \"on the edge\" !  The bread and pesto is DELICIOUS - perhaps a bad discovery as I could come back to this place just for that !  The red sangria is also fabulous.  We split a salad and a flatbread and a cheese plate - all were awesome - we wanted to try everything. Then 2 folks had scallops and for the non-seafood folks they had the veal ravioli - all were excellent - what we loved was they they split the plates already between us so there was no reaching over or fighting over the last piece  We will be back !',\n",

The food is great tasting but not something i would recommend for take out. Id say its a great place if you dont mind sitting in an extremely small and loud resteraunt, waiting half an hour for food. But yes, the crepes do taste quite good.',\n",

You could eat here a 100 times and probably still not try everything. That also means there is something for everyone! My go to order lately has been Il Purista sandwich, which has prosciutto, mozzarella, basil, tomato, peppers, balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I order it on a french role. I only order the half size because even that is quite large. And the best part, it's a ton of food for only $7!!! All the sides are tasty; I like the artichoke hearts and assorted olives. For desserts, I love their Tiramisu ($4), and cheesecake ($4). They also serve wine and beer. It's fast casual style, where you order at a counter and they bring out your food to the table. I will warn you that sometimes there is quite a long line, and it can take awhile to order. It's casual but not always fast. But even if there is a wait, they get the food out quickly and it's worth it!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This is such a great place for golfers and non golfers. I saw people coming in with their own clubs, but that was not me. I was here to have fun and to enjoy the food. I know they often have wait times but we went on Labor Day at 6:00 P.M. and were immediately shown to a table. They showed us how to use the system and within minutes Austin was taking our drink order. Drinks and appys were served quickly. The presentation on all of the food is awesome.  We ordered the bacon Mac and cheese spring rolls, the buffalo chicken sliders, quesadillas, and a sunrise burger. Everything was so scrumptious! Many items on the menu are perfect for sharing. One would have to work hard to not have a good time here. At night the music gets turned up a bit and the targets flash to the beat. Perfect for families, although probably not little ones.',\n",

All the crêpes and the coffee were great - the maple butter one being my favourite and with the most flavour. The prices ($3.50 - $5) were reasonable for the size and ingredients as well.\\n\\nThe only problem I had was with the slow service. The cashier was writing all the orders down by hand really slowly and I stood there while she wrote the last person's order for a couple of minutes without much acknowledgement from her or the many people working behind the counter. The crêpes, something I have experience getting fairly quickly, took a pretty long time. My coffee was brought to my table without creamer or without being asked about cream and there was no cream at the self-serve bar - all of which I found odd. It was a good thing I had no where to be or I would have been pretty upset. \\n\\nHowever, the taste of the crêpes outweighs any time inconvenience I experienced this visit. All the crêpes were exceptional and I might try to come back to sample the savoury offerings.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I think all the 5 star reviews are from people who work here, of which there must be 500.  Look at the trend all 5s then 2,3 and a few 4s.  I HATE that.\\n\\nFirst off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.\\n\\nLets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.\\n\\nNext the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.\\n\\nDrinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.   \\n\\nNow the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here.\\nNo value\\n\\nFood:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak.\\nMy mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.\\n\\nDessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.\\n\\nValue:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!\",\n",

It was done within 5 minutes, which I am happy about, however I was not happy with the taste. The sandwich was smothered in sauce, and was overwhelming my mouth with flavor to the point where I had to wipe off excess sauce. The patty was limp and tiny and although it was vegan, it could never compare to a real chicken patty. Overall, I was completely dissatisfied with my overly priced sandwich. The only good thing about this place was quick service and clean bathrooms.\",\n",

I ended up with the sweet potato pasta which is somewhat unusual for me. It was incredible! The broth was pretty sweet, but the waiter recommended the spicy ham which was a perfect balance.

We were referred by our hotel valet so we thought we would try it. Walking  thru the front door we had  to interrupt the hostess/host to ask for a table. They were in a deep conversation. Got sat,hostess not friendly at all,actually never said a word to us. Server came by super energetic but come to find out he was just  taking the drink order, All drinks came out fast expect for my wine from the bar. This place wasn't busy. Ordered an app early from the drink guy. When our server finally showed we ordered an another app after finding out all they serve is kale and leaf lettuce. She said your Nachos will be our before pretzel . Since we ordered nachos earlier that's what we expected. Well that didn't happen of course. Pretzels came out then eventually the nachos. Would never order the nachos  again!!!! Pretzels  snd fondue were yummy though!!! Not sure why the lack of service here... They had have many employees just standing around.\",\n",

This was suppose to be a SURPRISE get together for my boyfriends 35th birthday. He LOVES topgolf- one of the friends in the party agreed to get there at 345 to put our name in. She had never been to topgolf before and no one explained to her the process. She put our name down and requested two bays around 345 and she was quoted 30 minutes. This was perfect because every one was arriving around 4. We waited until 455 to be sat. UNREAL. We went up to the counter several times to check on the status of our group and the girl kept telling us ten more minutes. Absolutely unacceptable - just be honest and quote and hour and 15. We had dinner reservations at 730 25 minutes away and didn't start golfing until 500. When we were sat, we were told to quickly start so that we could receive the $35 an hour rate instead of the $45. Super unpleasant experience. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU HAVE A LARGE GROUP. It was a nightmare.\",\n",

It seemed that the bartender was more interested in prepping the bar for higher volume than even seeing if i needed more bread or having any conversation at all. I felt more like a nuisance than a paying customer. He served me some very old wine which he promptly changed out when I complained. As for the food, I ordered three pieces of bruschetta bread and one glass of wine. Those two items came up to be over $30. I could imagine paying as much if I were getting top-notch service with exceptional food, but the food was hastily put together and while somewhat flavorful, I would have paid $5 instead of $30!

       "  'text': \"Great Mexican joint in Old Town Scottsdale! Visited last night with my friend and we were pleasantly surprised. There was a 30 minute wait since we didn't have a reservation, but we decided to sit in the bar instead. At first the service was a little slow, but as dinner went on it was much better. \\n\\nWe both just ordered soda, so I cannot comment on the margaritas, but the bartender was cranking them out and they all looked delicious! Such a variety of tequila and drinks on their menu. \\n\\nWe started with the guacamole which was very fresh and topped with pomegranate seeds. It's the perfect combination! Their salsas were a little too watery, but good flavor. \\n\\nThere were so many things on the menu that we wanted to try, but decided on the Steak Burrito with refried beans and the Combo #5. The burrito was huge and covered with red enchilada sauce. The steak was cooked well and the beans were definitely homemade which is a huge plus for me. The Combo #5 was a Tinga taco, cheese enchilada, beans and rice. Everything was a hit!\\n\\nWill definitely return to try some of the tacos and the happy hour which is every day from 3-7pm!\",\n",

If they had given me samples, it would have saved me $8.74 because I would have run out the door right after the first bite.\\n\\nI think the place everyone else ate at, has been replaced and I found myself at the new Chino Bandido, a shit dump that serves food that tastes worse than if a Panda Express threw up on Del Taco. I should have known this would be a disaster if Guy Fieri has been here. When is his 15 minutes up? Every time I go somewhere that Guy Fieri has featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, it always turns out to be one of the worst places I have ever been. Guy Fieri knows as much about food as McDonalds does. First, I didn't even get what I ordered, They make a huge deal about how to order, how about getting the order right? What they gave me couldn't have been more opposite to what I ordered. I ordered black beans and plain fried rice. They gave me refried beans and pork fried rice, or some fried rice that was contaminated with a pseudo disgusting meat-like product. I ordered a jade red burrito, they gave me something with slimy pork inside, and I asked for a veggie quesadilla, they gave me a quesadilla with gross fatty chicken and a horrible sauce. The bag was filled with grease, even on the bottom of it. It made a bag from Five Guys look healthy.\\n\\nI guess for some, it is a novelty to mix Asian and Mexican. If you really want to enjoy such fusion, head to Vegas and try China Poblano, the creation of Jose Andres. If you are drunk or high, between the hours of 11 am and 9 pm and in Phoenix, and you have a need to consume a pile of shit, this place will satisfy such a craving.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Cool place. Great atmosphere. Excellent \"grocery\" selection. They stock a lot of local items like pickles from that pickling guy at the farmers markets. Queen Creek Olive company items. I didn\\'t think anything from the market was overpriced. The produce selection seemed quite reasonable. And the beer selection was great. I tried the BBQ as well, and I thought it was pretty damn good. I got the BBQ tacos not knowing what to expect but bbq + taco = awesome! What is nice about the bbq is that it is not swimming in sauce already. You choose your sauce and slather it on appropriately. I thought the bbq was a tad expensive but that is because my view is anchored to a little bbq shack in the middle of georgia where a sandwich would be 4. Drop that shack in N Scottsdale and I understand a 8 price. The 3 tacos were $10 and I\\'m full from eating 3/4 of it. So, figure 3.33 a taco, that is pretty reasonable considering the quality. And looking at other bbq joints around here, the price is comparable. Add the atmosphere, awesome sauces (low country may go down as my favorite), and great staff I think they have a winning combo. The hard part will be getting customers to that location. Its convenient from the 101 but not many folks travel on Bell Rd. I hope they kick ass.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I like enchiladas.  So, naturally, I have been frequenting Gadzooks for a little over a month now and am more than happy to submit an almost perfect review of their establishment.\\nPros:\\nFood is amazing.  With a very from scratch taste and feel I appreciate, along with new items that hit the chalk board and run the risk of availability, it's hard to go in and get the same old same old every time.  This is the one thing places like Chipotle can't exactly replicate and I admire; new flavors and dishes are what make this stand apart.\\nEnchiladas are made to order with enough customization choices to keep you going back.   Pulled Buffalo enchiladas? I managed the last one and considered putting it up on EBAY.  The enchilada oven.  There is something special about watching your dish enter the oven and the cheese bubbles with happiness.  \\nCons:  \\nGet there early.  Parking is at a premium though not as bad as most places on 7th st.  Here is my issue; the line.  The whole process operates like subway, chipotle, etc which isn't too bad but for the fact that your dish can come out of the oven and sit for minutes until you are able to pay, fight the single drink dispenser, and get seated.  I have on more than one occasion diverted to another restaurant if I spot a line out the door.  \\nTrue, good things come to those who wait but I dislike lines for food so that is my only hangup with Gadzooks, who otherwise has some of the tastiest enchiladas made to order I have had the pleasure of sampling for some time.\",\n",

I can\\'t live without a good dose of meat in me each week...wait, what....yeah, so bearing that in mind, when I came to Phoenix for this work trip, I knew I wanted to have a steak and a nice glass of spicy red wine at some point and so we came here since it was right near the bar we were at earlier. \\n\\nAs soon as we walked in I dug the place. The decor is pretty elaborate and it\\'s easily a million dollar design. Even the bathrooms look like spreads in design mags and with the high ceilings and intimate lighting, it\\'s a home run visually.\\n\\nAfter waiting about, oh 20 minutes, we were seated at a table and we all perused the menu. There were quite a few goodies that looked yummy, but my heart and stubborn mind was on steak and a medium rare one at that! I also wanted to try a salad, cuz I was starving and so I ordered the Caesar along with my Rib Eye.\\n\\nThe Caesar was okay at best. It definitely skimped on the dressing, so if you like your Caesar salad, Caesary, then maybe order a side of dressing as well. Then there\\'s the rib-eye. A magnificent looking piece of meat it was, but what did they give me to devour it with? \\n\\nYou guessed it, a butter knife.\\n\\nReally?\\n\\nReally.\\n\\nWhat in the Backstreet Boy Hell kinda bullsh*t is that? I probably wouldn\\'t have given the tenderness factor a second thought had it not been for the struggle to cut it with the wrong utensil. And it wasn\\'t an oversight either, this is what they intentionally give you to tackle your dinner with.\\n\\nLa-me.\\n\\nI enjoyed my meal and the steak was tasty, but please, do yourselves a favor and upgrade to steak knives, because it\\'s not tender enough to slice a dull blade through.',\n",
