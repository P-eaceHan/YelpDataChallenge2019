3fw2X5bZYeW9xCzzGhOHg,G7XHMxG0bx9oBJNECG4IFg,3,5,5,4,Tracy dessert had a big name in Hong Kong and the one in First Markham place has been here for many years now!   Came in for some Chinese dessert  and I must say their selection has increased tremendously over the years. I might as well add that the price has also increased tremendously as well. The waitress gave us tea  which I could taste had red date in it. Fancy!  A simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5.25 or something. Basically all the desserts were more than $5. That's crazy! I can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl  it would probably cost like $0.50. A few years ago  I think I can still get it for like $3-$4  which is more reasonable  but wow  more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert. Though I must say  it is Tracy Dessert  and they are a little more on the expensive side.   I also saw other items on the menu like fish balls  chicken wings  shaved ice. My friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it!   I'm also surprised how many people come to Tracy Dessert after work. We came on a Sunday and the tables were always filled. I think the amount of tables they had were just perfect because no one really waited for seats for a long time  but the tables kept filling up once a table was finished.
oxwGyA17NL6c5t1Etg5WgQ,RS_GTIT6836bCaPy637kNQ,3,1,1,0,It's a giant Best Buy with 66 registers.  I don't get it.  What's the big deal about this place??
8mIrXLrOnAqWsB5JrOojQ,kbtscdyz6lvrtGjD1quQTg,4,0,0,0,Like walking back in time  every Saturday morning my sister and I was in a bowling league and after we were done  we'd spend a few quarters playing the pin ball machines until our mother came to pick us up.  My sister was daring and play the machines hard  she was afraid of that  tilt  showing up and freezing the game.  I  on the other hand was a bit more gentler and wanted to make sure I got my quarter's worth.  This place has rows and rows of machines  some are really old and some are more of a mid 80's theme.  There is even a Ms pac man!  It was fun to spend an afternoon playing the machines and remembering all the fun of my early teen years.

It was a group of 10 girls so I was a little overwhelmed but Michael saved the day! Everything was super smooth and easy! We got good deals and had the best time ever! We booked hotel and a bachelorette package for a great price. I have saved contact info because I will for sure reach out again on next Vegas trip!!!
NyLYY8q1H3hfsTwuwLPCg,1wVA2-vQIuW_ClmXkDxqMQ,4,0,0,0,Great lunch today. Staff was very helpful in assisting with selections and knowledgeable on the ingredients. We enjoyed the BBQ chicken with tika masala sauce and really good naan bread. The biryani with chicken was also yummy! Fun to see the food being prepared in the tandoori ovens. Great addition to the fast casual scene in Cleveland.
cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGbA,6BnQwlxRn7ZuWdzninM9sQ,3,1,1,7,I love chinese food and I love mexican food. What can go wrong? A couple of things. First things first  this place is more of a  rice bowl  kind of place. I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes  but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first  but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.  I'm gonna admit  this place looks kinda dirty. I don't think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does  but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside  i'd give it a  C  grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room.   Mmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken  although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken  was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren't sure  ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering  but it was way too spicy for me.   The jade chicken quesadilla was decent  but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald's apple pie. If you order the burrito  be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs  but he said it was tasty.   They provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent  again nothing special.   Not gonna lie  the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. I used the bathroom like 5 times. I don't recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day.
6lj2BJ4tJeu7db5asGHQ4w,rEITo90tpyKmEfNDp3Ou3A,5,0,0,0,We've been a huge Slim's fan since they opened one up in Texas about two years ago when we used to live there. This place never disappoints. They even have great salads and grilled chicken. Plus they have fresh brewed sweet tea  it's the best!
yIw6dZflNix4BdwIyTNGA,4bUyL7lzoWzDZaJETAKREg,3,0,0,0,Good selection of classes of beers and mains. I've been here twice.  First time I had the fried chicken. It was delicious  but be warned  extremely salty. I couldn't even finish the last piece of chicken after experiencing a salt overload.  Second time we came on a wednesday. We didn't know it was BBQ night  where they have a completely different menu  and don't offer anything from their original vegetarian-friendly menu. This menu has one vegetarian-friendly option - an eggplant sandwich. The vegetarian in my party said it was awful. Also  on BBQ night you choose 2 sides. Except they were out of all their sides except 2 - fries and potato salad. I can't say I was thrilled to have carb heavy sides with my carb heavy main. How do you run out of sides so early in the evening?  Service not so great.  I'd avoid coming here on wednesdays.
qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ,Amo5gZBvCuPc_tZNpHwtsA,5,0,1,0,Our family LOVES the food here. Quick  friendly  delicious  and a great restaurant to take kids to. 5 stars!
I4NrMVc26qWr08S3Q1ow,IByf6mVY0WA838XNSh-5MA,4,0,0,0,The food is always good and the prices are reasonable.  Although it's not exactly a restaurant -- more like a snack bar  limited menu and you walk up to the counter  place your order  wait a minute or so for them to prepare your order  and pay the cashier  then search for a table.  Kind of like a sandwich shop.  Still a much better choice for value than the other hotel Deli's on the strip.
dLrfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow,S337tATeouQJdoPYyir29w,5,0,0,0,Pick any meat on the planet and the chef will make a Mexican style dish with amazing flavor! Wow  fish and lamb tacos to die for. Drinks are great as well.
hd5xm20tfSa706UqD9bg,W1wbNaUnbMy4b9QqY3_SAg,1,1,7,1,Unfortunately  I must recommend not to conduct any business with Fast Fix Jewelry and Watch Repairs.  The staff is completely unprofessional and I have never been treated so rudely in my life.  I was actually shocked and walked away thinking  wow  how do those people even have a job?   I have never written a negative review before  I usually chalk it up to someone having a bad day.  I have worked in customer service for 10+ years and I know it is exhausting and bad days happen.  But this is a special occasion.  I drove 30 minutes to try to find someone who could help me repair a watch band.  I was barely greeted upon arrival and right away felt like I was bothering them.  The girl behind the counter obviously just wanted me to leave  the blond kid working snapped at me when I asked a question and when I re-asked in order to clarify what he said he snapped again and said   I already told you?!?    Is this even authentic?   Shouting at me over his shoulder as he work on something else.   I was shocked and just stood there put my watch away awkwardly and left with no one else saying a word to me.  There are a lot of places that fix Jewelry in this city and I will be taking my business elsewhere and recommend that people reading this review do the same.  Some places  just do not deserve a loyal customer base.
Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw,qm97yMwREr7BKkexlwLFbg,5,1,0,0,their pettuccine was fresh-made in the morning. it was very delicate and yummy! the owner and staffs are super kind and delightful. We also had Veal piccata. it was classic! love this restaurant.
dm6sOY8JdKTE1ZM955yug,0AsmPiAQduxh5jE_si8cLA,5,0,0,0,ended up here because Raku was closed and it received great ratings on Yelp.  I'm so glad I came here.  One of the better meals I've had.  Started off with the mushroom dish and the lettuce wrap.  both were amazing. the lettuce wrap is like having a flavor party in your mouth.  also had the panang duck which was terrific. highly recommend all three dishes. one dish that wasn't so good was the seabass with drunken noodles. overall it was an excellent meal  intimate setting  and great service. definitely will be back.
CDpoJiqgM04wqQTZ6QkTqQ,CelUWzp-GnJIiiV1mDUb-g,1,0,0,0,Love this place downtown but the Scottsdale location has no manners. Sat at bar for 10 min while bartender ignored us. No menu  no water. We walked out and they could have cared less.
N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,wOv7JiO0EGcJ61P2JcDS1g,2,0,0,0,Went here last weekend and was pretty disappointed. They did not have one thing that was pictured and recommended on yelp as being good. We started off with the steak grilled skewers which were just Ok  nothing special. My freind got the lasagna and I got some special chicken dish. They were both pretty bland and lacking that kick. Our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes. My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked. With such a big name attached to this restaurant and going on such an empty stomach we had such high hopes. The service was great which is why i gave it three stars.
sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWtfMAg,RLbWoIri29BcQ8yjzsvQLQ,5,0,0,0,This place epitomizes the rumored transformation that is in the process of taking place in Pittsburgh. Great food  drinks  and service  but the atmosphere is second to none. Definitely a must visit for locals and visitors alike! You will not feel like you're in  Pittsburgh .
m7ommfJFalI47UksyX04Iw,eed44nI0eZ4BGKtKXsRJhQ,1,1,6,2,Met a friend for dinner there tonight. The server only brought us one menu. After she brought us a couple of Cokes she didn't come to our table for 20 mins. After trying to get her attention a few times when she walked by we decided to just order off the bartender. We received the starters and the mains at the same time. The wings  brisket  and mac and cheese were alright at best. At this point we hadn't seen the server since she brought the food  so we had to go to the bar for more napkins and refills on the Cokes. The most we actually saw our server was when she hovered over us as we put the tip into the handheld credit card terminal.   Food was somewhere between okay and decent. Service was somewhere between piss poor and terrible.
m7ommfJFalI47UksyX04Iw,UoFxqWXBluvS4Q32spb8Lg,4,0,0,0,Another solid BBQ place in Calgary. This is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious.   I actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However  it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years  and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.  Ok onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now  so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket  the catfish  the veggie burger  the mac n cheese  the cesar salad  the chili  and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries  this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean  seriously  vampires beware  but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.  The portion sizes are huge  so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.)   I bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well  not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless  the chili is ok (the meat was very tough)  and the service is also just ok. However  the catfish is delightful  the mac and cheese is also delicious  and the brisket is quality.   The specialty cocktails are also pretty good  and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch  after dinner drink  or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group  just make sure to call ahead.   All in all  like I said earlier  a great place for good times and smokey flavor.
jScBTQtdAt8RshaiBEHgw,j3vP8537KHvoXNHQIr3haA,5,1,1,0,Party of 3 ordered the fish tacos  pork belly banh mi  corn beef hash Benedict  and bam ham. Everything was delicious  esp the pork belly banh mi. It's tender and juicy and the baguette was nicely toasted. Love the crispy fish taco too. Their compliment chips and salsa were fresh and super good and crispy. Service was excellent. Our waitress did a great job checking up on us and serving us. I really want other food options too but I'm too full. Next time i visit i will definitely come back.
EIL41zhvVCeYHqfA9PyWQ,vzMkIQm34QWBCYaHdV-2mQ,5,1,1,0,Flat out fantastic!  Have been here twice and the croissants are the bomb. Can't wait until I can try other items. THE new breakfast spot in Ahwahtukee. The service is great as well. Family run business. Come and support them.
OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,u1jQX0KfnG3AHty4ifEpFA,4,0,0,0,notes: 1 visit  breakfast/lunch overall: Excellent high-end buffet  but the dessert section needs a little work.  highlights:  - Dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce  and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had. - Prime rib is excellent - I hate crab legs in general  but everyone else says they were great here  really fresh. - Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean  I was stuffed beyond belief  but I couldn't stop eating it! - If you get in during breakfast time  do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.  Avoid: - Gelato bar looks good  but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed. - Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross.
FBSWwaE6gR7KAOyG1QhakQ,#NAME?,5,0,0,0,Such a unique place & a great find. Our waitress was funny  knowledgable  and did a fantastic job. The food was amazing. We will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to other couples!
X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ,bvEdkl-weZGMLLRF9e0-ew,5,1,0,0,Best Wonton soup ever!!! Delicious food and great service. We had Chicken Satay  Roti C.  Wonton soup  and one of the fried noodle and shrimp dishes. Definitely will be back!
eoyvbnRYQez85e8Rc6vAg,7Jy730ib54YKYgZRvcBNJg,4,0,1,0,We had dinner here and the food was excellent and the service couldn't have been better! Thanks Jose!  We will be back for sure.
5FIOXmUE3qMviX9GafGHQ,SWiEJZUJM6rUDJFwbWB6OA,5,0,0,0,Absolutely love this place! I've been here many times and it never fails to impress me  the bff burger is unreal and the tsoynamis and cupcakes are amazing!! Everything is pretty much the best
hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL8Q,vAckaF8n0KKJeqHOnb1ayw,4,1,1,0,Here's why I don't write reviews for Chinese restaurants: I have to look up their English names...   It's so popular that I didn't try it until recently. The bubble tea here is really good. It's pricier than the one in Rose tea  but you also get more.  I like that noodles with pork sauce. I've tried both the thin and wide/thick noodles. The wide one is less chewy and are kind of sticky. I prefer the thin one for this dish. Dan dan noodles are different from what I was expecting. My friend liked it but it's just okay for me. The noodle with wonton is flavorless to me.  The soup dumplings are good but not amazing. If you've never had it before  give it a try and you probably will like it. I'd like to try noodles with beef soup next time.  The appetizers are too pricy in my opinion. I won't pay $6 for a small plate of vegetables again...  The owner is a nice guy and I enjoyed chatting with him a little bit during dinners.
OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,VqZMgUf4wQMTeCWg2M_e8Q,3,0,0,0,We went here Saturday for dinner. We had a 2-1 coupon. Price was $37 for two people so a good deal.   Very large space  open layout.  Been here a few times years ago. I ate mostly the crab legs. Prime rib.   They provide a self serve drink area  which I think is good.  You don't have to flag down a staff to get a drink when you want one. We've all been in that situation.   Unlimited alcohol  wines and beer. They have a bar area with one bartender working and a bunch of tv's to watch or get updates on games.   I wouldn't go out of my way  but if I was in Mirage and hungry  I'd eat there if we had another 2-1 coupon. I wouldn't spend full retail price eating there. Other buffets on the strip are better for same price points.
FBSWwaE6gR7KAOyG1QhakQ,HYBzY7zN_YBHtQu6qkD3Ng,5,0,0,0,Easily entering my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte after just one visit!  Pork Belly  unreal! Had an AMAZING prime NY Strip with bourbon butter jam  PHENOMENAL!
ZCsvwadsqNB8d8tYHPdjw,ASZha3MiQJghtt3n5OGIsA,4,0,0,0,This random hole in the wall is located in the Park Rd. shopping center.  I had never heard of it until that fateful St. Patricks day when another beer was in order.  After making my way there and enjoying the patio  I decided the food was my next venture.  After my second  alcohol only  visit  I was excited to taste what vegetarian options they had.  I had the grilled cheese with spicy asparagus and portobello.  Let me tell you...grilled cheese is amazing  add a few interesting touches  it becomes addicting.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  Also  they have a very tasty appetizer of Goat Cheese Fritters with a red wine sauce.  Goat Cheese is one of my favorites and frying anything makes it better. I was in love.   Ther service is great and they can accomadate large groups  the few times I've been has been with 7-20 people.  Great staff  awesome menu choices  I'll be going back
aNe8ofTYrealxqv7VtFTuw,XAm4_-lUxzF_Y449cWMHLQ,1,0,0,2,Th service here is very hit or miss... Sometimes the staff is personable and attentive. Other times I ask myself   Why do I come here???  The staff often has the   GTFOH  stamp placed permanently across their foreheads  and we as patrons just have to go with it  otherwise we are deemed  that guy.   I would say that my continuos visits were for the great HH  but there are several other options close to home  with the same food and drink options for me to choose from. I think today may be last visit...
anzCdD5eIEHwydTpXhLlUA,4PKiLkFTff9HK44QkOo6vA,4,1,0,0,Heard about this place and was dying to check it put-and I'm very glad I did! Decent beer selection and kind of a hipster vibe  but $8 for a loaded hot dog and tater tots has got to be one of the best deals in town. Tons of unique toppings to pick from and delicious dipping sauces for tots (secret fry sauce was my fav). We were there early and had no problem getting a seat at the bar  but I can see how during prime time or when live music is on how it could be kind of tight. If you're going for the food is get there earlyu because that loaded dog would have been super hard to eat while standing.
74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,x4FUjCh_QOOL4LEQQQM-6A,4,0,0,0,Met an old close friend for dinner at Portofino.  Great intimate dinning with class. Excellent pasta and meat dishes. Delightful service and great drinks. Will come back!
1HD5iUUfVJDbfEBIn9yVhw,qdQIIf6xuyubxEG05e02TA,5,11,11,8,Yes... the Boba Tea explosion is in full force. I have been to Lee Lee International Supermarket in Chandler many times  but I never noticed this little gem next to it until a couple years ago. Boba Tea House has serving up some of the best boba tea in the Valley long before it became a big thing. They have a fantastic array of flavors and drink choices to choose like fruit slushes  snow  milk tea  pudding  mango jelly  coffee jelly  etc. They even have snacks like popcorn chicken  fried tofu  and fries. The staff is super friendly and the prices are reasonable. I still laugh at my friends who have no idea what Boba Tea is or are too afraid to suck up one of those chewy ball things. LOL. In case you didn't know  Boba Tea is a flavored tea (usually with milk) to which chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies are added. I think they are super delicious. Today I got the Blueberry Milk Boba Tea and it made for the perfect snack in the middle of my day. Another favorite of my mine is the honeydew milk tea.
CGUK3cd2gxp2q3KPY19Oog,LrO2MkIWIjAoOeS5WImnrQ,5,0,0,0,Yum!! Had the kale grits and would definitely have those again! Menu choices are unique  farm fresh and delicious!
6xgcHeLadVaoTIQewK84A,VeJppsRLTWRKh4PkmcOzag,4,1,0,0,ooooooh yummy.  i'm a red meat eating midwestern girl  and 9 had the best steak i can remember having in....who knows how long  it was DAMN GOOD.  the mac and cheese is a tasty  tasty side.  try the snicker dessert...it's basically two cookie/ice cream sanwiches with bits of snickers.  the s'mores my sister got were super fun too.  only complaint is that it was really loud and waaaaaaay too many annoying veil-toting bachelorette parties for my taste.  but hey  it is the palms.
vhIJ91MDgUuk4Cr9Kpj1Nw,p9U8-Bj9tFBqHa-wgaDKJg,1,0,2,0,Dreadful Service  I've had Jimmy John's before several years ago in Minneapolis.. But apparently here in Phoenix  the store personnel must be trained differently. I had to take my sandwich back up to the counter twice to get the thick headed folks working at the one on Camelback at about 16th to get my sandwich the way I wanted it.  I asked for a #10 Hunter's Club with all the veggies. What I got was the standard #10 Hunters Club with lettuce and tomatoes.   After seeing that  I took it back up to the counter  and explained that I wanted all the veggies. They explained to me that those were all the veggies the sandwich came with. I carefully explained that I wanted all of the veggies that they have. The guy said  oh  you want the Freebies. I would have thought he would have clarified when I ordered whether I just wanted everything that came on the sandwich  or the Freebies as well. I said yes  I wanted all of the Freebie Veggies.   I took my revised sandwich and sat down to eat it  only to find that along with the veggies I had requested  they had piled on Italian vinaigrette and Dijon mustard  which I did not want.
8KmqWgL0UEdxJFwTZYZvQ,dS5ERxmIP-CQ_ZV_q_xc0A,5,0,0,0,These burgers are phenomenal! The Galley Boy just melts in your mouth  and paired with the potato teasers and a milkshake it is like heaven on Earth.
5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,m2H0m3pDUNmkXZP4K8c_oA,2,3,5,1,#1 it should be advertised as a vegetarian dinner. For the price we paid  I really would have liked a nice cut of meat.  #2. Way over priced. Dinner for 2 with (2) blue moon beers and (1) $10 glass of wine... $165+tip. We tipped over 25% because our server was great and the experience of eating in the Dark was a pretty interesting experience.  #3. The food was Meh... I would have been okay with everything else if the food was outstanding. It really wasn't... I probably ate 3 bites of my dinner entree just to taste what the different Ingredients were... It was far from savory and could have used even a pasta or something. A couple of dry (what tasted like hush puppies)?? I would have been impressed a little if when I told the server that I didn't enjoy it if he would have offered to try one of the others  but I didn't make a big deal because like I said before he was really nice. The dessert was literally the only saving grace.  All in all I gave a 2 star... (server and experience in the dark)... I just have to be honest incase others go in expecting a non-vegetarian meal... Be ready for a $200 vegetarian dinner!!!! *** also if they don't like your review on their Facebook page they will block you from commenting on other people talking crap about you  they can not handle the truth and allow others to put you down ***
yNPh5SO7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ,JYdhCDyR6lYfN2qnSspLlQ,5,0,0,0,First off food is DELICIOUS! By far my favorite restaurant in downtown Phoenix. I have tried so many different things from the menu and it never disappoints  but the Saturday night special Prime Rib and Horseradish Dauphinoise Potato is my favorite. Second  the service is amazing. Ian is my favorite waiter  will request him every time! He is so personable with a good sense of humor! He constantly is checking up to make sure everything is good (but not too much). He made the experience at the Arrogant Butcher memorable!
sk0stgY4NDJYOX1MbNJ3Pg,SneRds-D0MCMWbIitd0AHg,1,0,0,0,At least the Pinks concession stand by Section 3.  Unqualified servers who don't tell you that they won't take cash - and they seriously won't take cash.  Then the manager wouldn't even take the cash to another register. The lines are stupid  long and the workers incapable of handling the slightest issue. I m sitting upstairs if there is a next time I come to a Knights game.
HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,29S2A-Q8Vt4a-Z6St1dcWw,4,0,0,0,Wonderful experience. We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it  this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket  beef short ribs  pork ribs  Caesar salad  bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton  which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels  fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top  which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive  you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy  it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people  it may be too much but for me  this is a good thing!
EgwGTDZ705TwudPJwAY0yQ,W6VRRz7mVGZLsidyHelHwg,5,0,2,0,This place is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.   My favorites are the Chicken Scarpariello  the pizza and the Sangria. My wife can't decide between four dishes. Our daughter loves the Penne ala Vodka  Lasagna  or Ravioli.  Mario and his sons work hard to please and we've never had a bad meal here. I've seen them bend over backwards to try and take care of obvious jerks.   Plus to top it off  when local school invited local pizza places to present to a class on making pizza and recycling issues  Mario came and talked to the kids as if they were adults. All the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons.   Get the idea? It's all good at this neighborhood gem!
PFmBiraAbTN9XMka7soqQ,m7eosmcK66RU_61UHbNMww,5,0,1,0,Today was my first time seeing the staff at Bella Smile and it was a great experience.  Although I'm not currently living in Las Vegas I plan on coming back for checkups and any other problems that may arise.  There was no wait time whatsoever and I was out of there without a drop of pain or discomfort.  The manager Severn was very accommodating and will be getting business from my family and friends in town.
Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw,l7KB334CXThAcmZPOvF1zw,2,1,3,1,Normally  I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However  our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted  we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian  but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.  First  we changed our reservation  and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly  they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant  quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault  wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.  I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian  but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty  a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However  I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous.   To top it off  we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok  so I expected we would receive a dessert  as is customary. We received nothing. Of course  our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.
xS5HGqgk0KY2jFWUlnrA,RKGH2ZQHyBNgJwQ84lKMFg,4,0,0,0,I'm not that familiar with Scottsdale so I'm just guessing that this restaurant is fairly new. The atmosphere is great and lively but s but loud. They have a huge wine and drink list.   The food was really good  I highly recommend the ahi tuna appetizer  ravioli and the skirt steak!
XXWOFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,kQAHUQ89fIZVCf1cFKDE_Q,4,0,0,0, Good morning  cocktails for you?   Wait...what? Oh...it's Vegas!  Dining here  you best not be dieting because this place is literally the definition of excess  but in a good way. I'm a sucker for benedicts so that was awesome.  Service was really great too and the staff was so welcoming. It was our first stop just after landing so really appreciate the service.  Back in Hawaii this reminds me of Zippys or Anna Millers - that home feeling. Prices are a bit high  but for what you get it's totally worth it. Will remember this place if I ever return to Vegas in the future.
HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,jdDxglqBqPJPYQO5QlY8pA,5,0,0,0,Hands down best Bloody Mary ever. So many things in my BM  veggies  mmm bacon.   Nailed it  it's an appetizer. I also had the burger with fries. Who knew fries could be so good. The presentation doesn't disappoint ether. Very nice. Great seating outside although we sat inside. Would love to see this restaurant near my hometown. Seriously. Get the BM. You rock Guy!
qaPSbg690KaX5av6xsSV4Q,IWinoppaEcMt5DrreAUR0Q,1,0,4,0,I have no idea what the owner's problem is  but he's incredibly rude. His wife  on the other hand is super nice (an odd mix).  Great space  rude owner and the coffee is average.
r5PLDU4mSbde5XekTXSCA,lDJIaF4eYRF4F7g6Zb9euw,4,0,2,0,I used to work food service and my manager at the time recommended I try Defalco's. He knows food well so I was excited to try one of his favorites spots.  This place is really  really good. Lot of authentic Italian choices and they even have a grocery section with tons of legit Italian goodies. I had a Chicken Parmigiana sandwich that was to die for. Anytime my ex-manager comes back to town (he left for Vegas and I think he misses Defalco's more than anything else in the valley)  he is sure to stop by and grab his favorite grub.  Parking is a bit tricky during busy hours and the wait times for food can get a bit long  so I recommend calling your order ahead of time (unless you want to take a look around while you wait  first-timers).
AfEOC5LlBeMt708QEQUihw,WD-cSY1y13oRdY77EjZL_g,1,0,2,0,Ok so I have purchased items from RC Wiley and have spent a lot of money but will never again. I had a $500 credit limit after I purchased my fridge and when  iwent to use it towards ny bed room purchase it was no longer available due to me paying it off too soon????? (Apparently since I paid $500 in 2months instead of $25 in 10 months) When we attempted to question what they meant and if there was anything that couldbe done the supervisor emele pretty much told us to take a flying leap -are you serious!!  So I spent my $2300 at Ashley furniture. RC Wiley apparently is balling and they don't need me to buy anything. Good luck! when u have poor customer service reps representing you like that their making your company look bad.

EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw,rHGTcKIfLTE9Y26aNJ__Yw,2,0,0,0,Just ok. Not a fun true busy dim sum place and I'm so sure they don't make their own food. Won't be back soon.

They have all the games on  great bloodys  and awesome breakfast!  Loco is my local watering hole and I always have a great time with the staff.
biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,z1rYuaKCL6xkacLIIaxr_g,3,0,0,0,The decor and everything int he restaurant is really nice and sheik looking. We got the Resting Panda and the Whiskey sour  both of which were very tasting drinks. We started with the Foo Foo plater (just to be able to try a bit of everything). It was pretty good actually  I'd highly recommend it! Our server (i believe her name was Nicky) was super awesome and really nice and helpful. She decided on getting the pork belly ramen and two sushi rolls. The ramen was good  a little salty  but I'd recommend it. Then we received the Spider roll  which was great. Next up was the Crispy roll  which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server  and although the server came over and apologized several times  it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize. We finally got it and it was okay  and they ended up comping it  which was nice. I'd give this place one more try...But I most limey wouldn't order the crispy rice roll again.
tjAeaGdxf7I4xN9M7wGJNQ,TaoaX7MqCujFRNaJBns2Sw,5,4,8,5,While the prices are a bit high for a make-your-own pizza  the taste makes up for it. I love going to Seventh Street market  sitting Not Just Coffee and having a drink while waiting for delicious fresh made pizza from Pure.  I've taken this to go as well as eaten inside the market  and I can say that the pizza doesn't do well reheated. So try to eat it fresh while there if possible.  If one of their specialty pizzas sounds good to you  go for it  as those are definitely a better deal for the amount of toppings you get for the money.  I wanted what I wanted  though  so I ended up with a medium  thin crust  regular crust pizza with jalapenos  pepperoncini  onions and feta.  It was pretty expensive at $2/topping = $20 med pizza. But it was delicious.  The arugula salad with goat cheese and lemon vinaigrette is to-die-for. I crave that dressing days later. So light and fresh but flavorful.
w6F502EKMyn3ONbGT2bQxw,_LPOtmfWnL_8_tL3ImhoLw,5,1,1,0,Not sure why some posted negative reviews of this place because it is on point. My girlfriend and I had dinner there last night  with reservations set for 6 p.m.  were seated by 6:05. Our server William was awesome  was fast  attentative and really was one of the best servers we've encountered and we dine out a lot. We both ordered all you can eat crab legs and they were fresh  hot and delicious. I do feel the sticker price was high but we must have had 5 buckets each so it equates to 10 bucks a pound.   The only negative I did feel could be addressed is the tables are made of some type of epoxy resin so being outside  May be melting or something because there was a sticky residue on the table top. I just played a napkin over it so it was acceptable.   My girlfriend and I will definitely be returning to pickle bills  we had a fantastic evening. Last thing to note  the service was great even though the place was packed!
4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA,pT5KSTwYBtKoDG61filWXw,4,0,0,0,After being a HUGE fan of the Mission I decided to try this place out seeing that it's owned by the same owners even though I was very skeptical that it could possibly be as great. To my surprise it lived up to what others had told me. The ambiance was amazing. Very much like the mission. Candles light up the entire place. The outside patio is quite large and there is a lot of seating available. The staff was great and very helpful with making suggestions on the menu. My favorite items on the menu are the scallops and the Apple caramel upside down cake. They were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. They have a great wine list and its a perfect setting to enjoy a few glasses of wine:) This is a great date night spot that I recommend it now to all my friends.
1xuC540NychtiWFeJdw,m1sRMnzfUx_OffTU9tfCZg,4,1,0,0,Très bon poulet avec la petite sauce piquante c'est succulent . Beaucoup trop de frite dans les assiettes . Il n'y a pratiquement pas de place dans l'établissement et il faut souvent faire la file pour commander . Mieux vaut prendre en take out . Jai pas goûter à la Poutine mais ça va l'air intense . J'ai eu envie de donner trois étoiles étant donné la file et le peu de place   mais étant donné qu'il s'agit d'une des meilleures rôtisserie portugaise ( oublier l'infâme Piri Piri ) je lui en ai mis quatres .
YF4QJjPM7cMZja6K1MwQ,h41f8n78an6ZdhRzKMCT1w,5,0,0,0,What an awesome pool party!!! I wish there was a tad more interactive aspects. I want hot girls and guys spraying champagne all over us or dancing with us.
Kz4WS00PcqOJgxfZawk4dQ,NFlW7_5bOPkR2Nz8t9d2Sw,4,1,0,0,I love Pizza  but I try to stay away for dietary reasons. I went here last week with my daughter and mom  and was pleasantly surprised. Thin crust New York style pizza at a good price. The menu is kind of simple  but that's the way these places are nowadays. Friendly staff and clean simple surroundings.
gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,EedJ77WTwkytYhAR-PVMKQ,5,0,0,0,Five stars! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for authentic Latin American cuisine. Coming from someone raised in Latin America  I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles  they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be. However  Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home. Besides that  the latin music was on point and the cocktails were great too!
Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,ga8yPF_gxHby3DYe5uwO5A,5,0,1,0,Oh. My. Gosh. I'm not going to write much except that it was DELICIOUS. I came here because of all the reviews and seriously it was worth the drive. I had the spring rolls and those were delicious. Then I had the noodle ye-saw with shrimp. And I pretty much licked my plate. And all the plates going by looked better and better. I'm already planning the next time I come here. And my server was a sweet sweet girl. Soft spoken but just the perfect server. I'd take a picture of my food but I dove in and cleaned my plate. Lol. Oh well. There are 254 pics for you to choose from.
mffVbMp5v7S6r9Xp5a1JJQ,BEtPgLx4Abz_8fkNLY2WVQ,5,0,0,0,Amazing!!! Clean and pretty! Best service I've been in Las Vegas! Everyone are so nice! And all the design are perfect
0xyqLvtr0Zbr4GgMLQmQ,kz-EVInXbGuDwglTZhig3w,3,0,0,0,I'm not that pleased with this experience. For the price  I expected better ambiance and better presentation. The steaks were seasoned and cooked well. Our family enjoys a good cut that's perfectly done to each person's speculations. Also the service was perfect. Our server was thoughtful and attentive  without overly interrupting when we didn't need anything. However  for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu  we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive  more fancy  not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price  we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return. If I'm paying this much  I'd like to feel a little more pampered.
FStFa2esHFgsAjVzIGJcQA,oMRfgrni0xBWo5zKaoxD4w,2,0,4,0,Well they definitely lost me as a customer! RC Willey here I come!  My father  who is 69 years old  moved out here from Los Angeles the beginning of this month to be closer to me and my kids. I ordered and fully paid for a bedroom set for him. They called me like 4 days before the order was to be delivered to confirm the appointment. I advised the lady that no one was living in my father's apartment yet but if they could call me as they are on their way I could rush down to the place and open the door for them. I mean I live in the same complex so it wouldn't be a long wait! She said she would let the guys know but no promise...okaaaaay? I paid $1 200 for furniture  I am a repeat customer  and you can't make one quick easy courtesy call? Well I missed their delivery and no call was made. I found out from my LandLorD that they came because they went to the office and he was going to let them in but they said no because someone had to sign the paper. To top it off  when I got my dad's key to check the place out before he arrived  there was a note on the COUNTER that said  Sorry we Missed you ....so they entered the apartment and left the note but couldn't put the damn furniture together?? They denied going in but how the hell did the paper get on the counter? Anyway my dad arrived with NO furniture and we had to pay $50.00 for them to deliver the furniture again 3 DAYS LATER. My father has bad arthritis and basically no cartilage in his knees making it very hard for him to get up from low areas such as couches and FLOorS which he almost had to sleep on if it weren't for my friend who let us borrow her air mattress luckily. He still couldn't get up though and crawled to get around his place until I was able to get to his place after work :(. Bottom line  they are not for their customers at all and their attitude after you purchase their crap shows it all. I will never be back.
seYvTmOZGJ2IAMdfQa8pkg,qdfEZn3ObIEHC-tiX1aduw,3,1,1,0,I've been here 2x wasn't impressed the first time figured give them a second try. There latte doesn't impress me I'd rather goto the Starbucks adjacent to this spot
LW21U6m6axC2lCLYc0fFSA,DnjyWYnv95PjPx5tazakEg,4,0,0,0,Their red velvet cupcakes are AMAZING! Their buttercream frosting is fantastic and I also like their brownies when they have them. The location couldn't be better. I'd say you couldn't find a more romantic date-spot. I won't give them 5 stars though  since I have had some dry cupcakes in the past and they seem to always run out of the good stuff (mostly the red velvet) on weekends which is the only time I can make it over there.
0xyqLvtr0Zbr4GgMLQmQ,yjjaOFx6ojWzNQjhN9uEoQ,5,1,0,0,The 5 for 6 'til 7 is so awesome and such a great deal! I wasn't sure the first time we went if we should dress up or if it was okay to wear jeans and a nice top but everyone was either in their business casual work clothes or jeans. I would recommend getting there a little early because it fills up quickly! We got there at 6pm and by 7pm it was pretty full.  I have recommended this to so many of my co-workers and friends to try out and so far anyone that has gone has come back to me saying what a great time they had and how surprised they were with the 5 for 6 'til 7 deal :)
Z66xOB7trDah8F0PKwRqg,Pin7lN2A9XzBVpzgq4-wgQ,4,0,1,0,We stopped by for a little shopping. The mall is nicer than most and has plenty of stores. It was a nice way to spend a few hours before heading on to another adventure.
0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw,oDxnoU49up9-wTnJ7RttBQ,5,0,2,1,Unbelievable experience start to finish.  We had a reservation for 9pm Saturday. When we arrived our table wasn't ready yet but the host asked if we wanted drinks and took our drink orders. There is no drink menu here - the staff is the drink menu- which was nice. Everyone is very knowledgeable and quick with recommendations.  Our party was big so we were seated outside on the patio which was enclosed and heated.  The menu changes a lot apparently and there is also a pretty big specials menu. For apps we got oysters  a sea urchin (from the specials menu)  the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu)  and the veal tartare. Everything was incredible and pairings were perfect. For example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters.  For dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti. The portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce  bacon and huge lobster chunks. Each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster.  Every wine pairing we tried was amazing.  Unfortunately we had no room for dessert but the meal was definitely above out expectations.   Expect to be here for a while. Our reservation was at 9 and we only finished eating at 11:37- and we're not slow eaters. I think the wait had to do with our party being big and the rest of the place being packed
UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q,IQ6yUAb-sCu4iQ5MMjDCHA,5,0,1,0,Wild every night! My favorite place hands-down in AZ! The night life here is contagious and Iv never been disappointed with there Sunday fun day! Every Sunday they have a corn hole competition and crazy drink specials like penny refills!! You also have to try there duck and pork tacos or there Hefe Hamburger! My favorite margarita on the menu is the la chica flaca. If you want a fun place to get lunch and a few drinks or looking to go crazy night this is the spot.
Nc7cqq5k0WZsVhu25QrmNQ,485juGN7xennwKdLzToQrw,5,0,0,0,The gang at Sun Valley Stereo is definitely top notch. Ryan gets right to the point and saw what I was interested in  and we worked together to verify that all the parts were in to upgrade my 2004 RX-8 with a Pioneer 4000NEX touchscreen and back-up camera before I drove 90 minutes for the work. When I first left there was some adjustments needed. They took me back in without hesitation and made everything right. The installer was committed to treating my car like it was his own. He took the extra steps to make it all right  and even fixed the hatch door to my 12-volt socket. Now that's going the extra mile! 6-stars!
vGDhK2Lc4Np5iZYZ7FG0QA,e57Ecf1NsH7bVHr47ZnvSw,5,1,1,1,Please try this place. The food is incredible and you can tell the people that run it are super-appreciative of everyone that comes through the door. They are very proud of their food and they make sure to tell you it's all made in house - i.e. no cans of anything. The lady that served us must have significant influence on the food as she told me she is from Mexico City so a lot of the food made is from the city's influence. I told her I was visiting MC in January and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities.  The enchiladas I had were unlike any I've ever had. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? The chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla. The two tortillas were sautéed in green chiles  folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish. It was then topped with lettuce  chicken  crema and all the other good stuff. It was the best I've ever had. I mean it.  Warning: When the dish indicates it's spicy  it's spicy. Those were the spiciest enchiladas I've ever had  but I appreciate the spice. My gf  however  was fortunate in her decision to get the carnitas because she would have not been able to handle the enchiladas.   By the way  the carnitas were excellent  as well.  This place gets five stars and I can't wait to go back. Please  please try this place. It was empty when I walked in and that's a shame. They should have a lot more business if it was all based on the quality of their food and service. It's also very affordable. Chicken enchiladas were $9 and the carnitas were somewhere around there (maybe $12).

d8lmIZIqmBC9oPM8y1dc7Q,xLPt2YOqBTJ1fNwC3bPdOw,3,0,0,0,I've dined here a few times with my family and we keep coming back  despite a few misses.  I really want to be a fan of this place though. The red salsa is good and hot while the green satisfies the less adventurous.  The guacamole (made to your specs at the table) is delicious and its pretty much all my 4 year old eats there.  I normally get the tacos  either brisket or fish and they're really great  though I'm not a fan of mango salsas in general.   Last night we had the guac and a couple of Wednesday special margaritas which were just right.  We thought the chips tasted a little stale though and the small bowl  coupled with distracted waitstaff  became empty quickly. My wife and I split the main dish  which was a special  baked brisket enchilada  recommended by the waitress.  It was huge and definitely more than enough for too  but we didn't care for it. There didn't seem to be much beef in it; it was mostly sauce and cheese.  It will be awhile before we go again  and I think we'll stick to the tacos when we do. In summary  lots to like here  but I'd say stick to the basics.
WKOUTdVJS58E178JjhwidQ,JQqkuljXAr169_5Pqe-xLA,4,1,1,0,I love coming to pastel ! My favorite items are the black sesame crepe and the green tea crepe. Their waffles are good too  but I personally like crepes more. The ice cream and whipped cream is not too sweet which I like. I recently tried their matcha batter crepe  it wasn't bad  but I prefer sticking to plain crepes with green tea or black sesame ice cream.  I think pastel is a great dessert spot after having dinner around the area. The outdoor seating also makes it a perfect date spot in the summer.
9t8PEynZGVCG1EjOQr1xBA,21XPYcGfDDOwRWZrUpJn7A,5,0,2,0,Seeing  Chicago  in the name of a taco shop gave me a little pause  but the food and employees are both 5 stars.   The Asada fries were awesome! The meat was well seasoned and had that perfect grilled crunch that I love. You can choose nacho cheese or cheddar   I chose the cheddar  and they put a good portion on.  It's topped with Pico   sour cream   and a huge scoop of fresh guac. Lovely dish!  I also had a pastor taco  which is just like a traditional street taco you would find elsewhere.  The pastor was perfectly seasoned and had the same crunch from being grilled.   Overall a great experience: Food was great and the staff was very friendly.  The owner came to the table to  ask how the food was and we talked for a few minutes. He was genuinely interested in feedback and his passion for cooking and providing a great experience for his customers was very evident.  I recommend everyone stop in and give this place a try.  It is now on my list of regular lunch spots when I am on the N. Side.
eS76100l3h7Ollb5s3M4A,VaNUI2jmyGABdjXcRwlSOA,4,0,1,0,What a cute place! I was visiting relatives in the area and we went here to grab coffee and breakfast.

WRQ9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,CxrS26JYuIRlPqZOM3uoQg,5,2,3,1,Went to Vegas again Memorial Day Weekend but this time with my girlfriends so wanted them to try this place since LOVED it so much when I came with hubby.  This time tried the Angry Dog and just as amazingly deelish!!!  Friends got Chili (homemade by Buldogis) Dog  Bulgogi Bowl  Fries  and again the Euro Fries with kimchee added and they LOVED it too!   My 2 friends who had the Chili Dog said the chili was very good! One of them is not even a hotdog fan and loved it :)  IF you are EVER in Vegas THIS is a MUST!!!

t61eGISz7qMOxEe7o3vwEw,BEReRBLL-_OkMyUcKYb-Lw,5,0,1,0,Perfect Grilled Cheese was amazing and worth a repeat  visit.  Chicken club lacked unique flavor and was average.  The BLT was great with the bread making the sandwiches.  Now for the sides: tomato soup was delicious and a perfect complement to the grilled cheese.  Shoe string fries were great  nothing not to like about them and the green pea salad in peanut sauce was delicious.  We will definitely return for another try!
ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,#NAME?,1,0,0,0,As soon as I parked my car  this rude elderly lady comes out saying these parking spaces are reserved...I UNDERSTand and CAN READ THAT ON YOUR SIGN lady.  Just because my other family members are dinning at Hong Kong Garden for Dim Sum does not automatically mean that EVERYONE is looking to eat there.  I was and had a craving for deli sandwiches in which I did ended up walking in to purchase 2 as planned (receipt still in hand).  Don't go around assuming and start off with horrible service.  I ended up keeping my car parked there the WHOLE afternoon taking a space just because that lady was rude.   ***Also would be nice to offer water for your customer that is waiting for his to-go order***
Wxxvi3LZbHNIDwJZimtnA,Sft1a3j3Hst44CG9gbww0Q,1,2,8,4,I am so blown away by this sophisticated & beautiful hotel. One of the best in Las Vegas. The decor is breathe taking  and this place always smell like a magical garden. With so many top notch restaurants  spa services  shows  and clubs to choose from. It's vegas luxury! The last time I stayed here  July 2011  it was such a BIG disappointment. There was a total of 8 of us. One of the bed broke and fell flat to the floor (no  there were no foul play)! 6 out 8 of us left with some kind of bug bite that looks like a terrible case of eczema/rash! The mechanic curtain didn't work. The main T.V. didn't work. Actually  disappointed is an understatement  WE WERE DISGUSTED! How can this 5star resort & hotel failed us so miserably!!!!!?   (please view pictures of rash)
ybbcg01j7tKJoLEY1uPQ,SS6cONwKT6FSxnNtUicuLQ,5,0,0,0,Came to this place based on yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. Got the chicken wings to start  kao soi with chicken and an dish from the chefs special - Steamed fish coconut curry. Chicken wings were good  especially when hot  the sauce gelatinized as it cooled. Kao soi was the best I've ever had  an excellent portion ans the chicken was very tender. The the fish coconut curry was good too  wasn't much of a curry but was still very flavourful. Service was fast and people were so friendly and kind. Will definitely go back to try other menu items.
c9SKd0bIR6nNzXOVCbOiA,2spIgkW8gWBCoWWVfOocrQ,5,0,3,3,Ikea....an experience!  I adore Ikea! There is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room  hence  the showroom.  When you go to Ikea  it is simply a MUST to enjoy the top floor showroom area. What I would have given to have had Ikea in NC when I got my first apartment. Not only are the items affordable but seeing Ikea's recommendations of how to decorate  supply  and organize a living space in 640 sq. feet is a miracle! It totally works and somehow I find myself wanting to go live in a space that small!   Ikea can be intimidating in it's size and there being SO MUCH STUFF but it is well worth it! I always go to Ikea with a list of items that I am needing for the home and I always find it  while also finding MUCH MorE to leave with. The greatest part of Ikea is the price! There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars/trucks/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea! This is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you  the shopper!  Do yourself a favor  plan a day! Go and spend a few hours upstairs in the showroom  have lunch in the cafe.... rest a bit  then venture downstairs to get all the stuff your heart desires!   Ikea....an experience!

a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,2ofBIfK5Bx6SPo3K5_ITCw,5,1,2,0,Go. Seriously. You will not be disappointed one bit!  We were craving breakfast food and decided to check this place out. We shared a skillet and a few breakfast sides  each of which were cooked to perfection and super tasty. The atmosphere here is cute  clean  and just what you want for enjoying your breakfast.   What really made our day being here was our awesome server  Tina. She was so cool  upbeat  easy to talk with  and was the most accommodating server you could ever hope to have. We plan on returning for more good eats and to see Tina again. :)
MBanyASw0fX21eHOg1m5pA,iIfmkqaJgyIHpjW6QQMOug,2,0,2,2,The one and only cashier working was so slow and  chatted with every customer while there is a long line. I never seen anything like it! Shooting the breeze while there is a long line of people who have other things to do is unacceptable. With all the other negative reviews I hope they get there act together because Sephora has much better service and hate to see another store close.
RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg,o7ruWhpWj5hiCtvT1fh0gw,3,2,3,2,We had the curry it was really good but it was small portion for it's price.. the garlic chicken wasn't satisfying since it was dry  no spices  very plain and the chicken was kinda hard. Presentation was ok  you gotta order the rice seperate.. the service was fine the servers were pretty casual with their guests. Would come back for curry but not for tandoori or kabob.
0qSKZhVCBHPuKro4QGWJw,urlwE4-r6BBnQHRgIdNZ7w,5,0,0,0,Hank's definitely stays on my list of places that wow me. Great atmosphere from the bar area with live music  to the great booth in the dining room with all the hustle and bustle of the staff creating that fine dining experience.  We felt very comfortable and well taken care of. Even had the manager share a bottle of wine with us! A memorable evening.

UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q,#NAME?,5,0,0,0,I love this place. I come here whenever I'm in town for business. The taco Tuesday deals are unbelievably amazing. The tacos are only two dollars each  but they could be charging much more for the quality that they are. They also have a good IPA on tap that is only five dollars a pint. All of the staff is incredibly nice and they have great music here too. I also love the fact that there's tons of monitors everywhere so you can see games from every angle of the venue. They also have a great outdoor seating area that is right on the sidewalk and located on a busy downtown corner which suits all the people watchers well.
uLnPW9K1yhNpgzvodCumbQ,OV3RdHNC4Mkg_wWAe8rG0A,4,0,0,0,Love this place. Great atmosphere - sports bar but with just the right amount of class. Great house beers  friendly serving staff  amazing drunk food. A fun place to go with friends ir family + an adventuruous take on the traditional bar menu
tstimHoMcYbkSC4eBA1wEg,iWFBGYotfzwiLsOka0e1Rw,4,0,0,0,We found out about this gem from The Man's co-worker who used to live in the same apt. complex we live in now. It's about a mile away from our apt. and we finally gave it a try a while back.   It is delicious! The chips are mini tortillas that you break off and have with salsa. Very yum. The food is delicious! I don't remember what I had the last time we went here  but I managed to finish more than half of it and had some to take home (tastes better later  IMO). The portions are generous and filling.   The wait staff is always nice and attentive. I remember the first time we visited  it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait too long for a table.   If we're in the mood for mexican food and don't want a fast food experience  we definitely choose this place.
gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,C0onMemq7n2bMx3fMQXF9w,4,0,0,0,Went in on a Friday since I was strolling around the Venetian and came across this place! The wait wasn't too bad around 1pm (probably 25 minutes max). This place serves a variety of Latin American cuisines including tapas  tacos and burgers! It's standard pricing for Vegas. I ordered the brisket tacos and I didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary. Service was okay  but I thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating. However  the portions are on the smaller side so it's perfect to have lunch there if you don't want lug any leftovers around!
Wxxvi3LZbHNIDwJZimtnA,EaXwNVOmpCXwCchMR5TWlQ,3,0,0,0,Paid for a view of the strip...Very disappointed.   Viewed the pool  saw through TI facade  Trump tower.  Not worth the extra price.  Restaurant choices were great  food was good  casino was fun.  Rooms are okay.  Would think twice before staying again.  Customer was excellant.  The staff is out standing.
LwNZ1AR45iukgQYuhmTOg,fPRmEOJy0DoT8P8YQDF5lQ,5,6,6,5,I'm a fan of BMW.  My X3 lasted me 10 years and although there were a few hiccups  I can still say that car was pretty darn reliable and I got my money's worth. But sometimes  you just have to let go and find a replacement.  I did my research and considered getting a Mini  Fiat or a Lexus. My loyalty is with BMW. I locked in on a particular car and off to the dealer I went. We were walking around the lot looking at other models and colors when a car salesman saw us and helped me get my car. My sister kept throwing her ideas and opinions as to what car I should get. I told David (sales advisor) what features I need and we ended up with the first car I was looking at.  Then  the dreaded test driving the car. I'm not a big fan of driving a car that isn't mine...or driving  period! I think convincing me to test drive took the most time and David told me to just drive around the lot but that was a trick! There was a part of the lot that's blocked off by a semi and the only way around it is to get on the road. My sister was a backseat driver as if I needed to be more anxious but David kept me calm. He's so funny. We made it back to the dealership in one piece.  I signed my papers and wrote my check but it was gym time so  we told David we'd come back for the car after the gym since they still had to detail it anyway. It was the most entertaining car-buying experience ever. We were all laughing and chatting about cars  the gym  nutrition  Hello Kitty  Yoda  etc. David explained and showed me what my car can do and at the end he said   I wish all my clients are as fun as you.   I get follow-up phone calls and e-mails and if I have any questions about my car  David responds quickly.  If you ever need/want a car  contact David Politzer - he is fantastic and he has a nice profile picture on his business card too.
FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,3Qc49B7dA0ONmCxrn5iwCQ,2,4,13,5,OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below)  but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...  There are not many  old  restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an  Old Western Vegas  feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955  it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged  carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers.   FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made  I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total  three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak  smoked prime rib  was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time  right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care?   I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.    I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg  is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre  that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough  butter  and three types of cheese.   A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it  I was grateful to have passed on this wet  mush.   SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks.   I won't be back  but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.  Service: 4 stars  Kitch: 4 stars  Food: 1 star
ONyDFp4eO9TigeM2wdiMQ,UDvBqO7LbjGgV9_jCjFwlg,4,0,0,0,Love this place.  We go all the time.  Wings are the best cocktails are good and well priced.  Don't confuse with the terrible place with a similar name on Thurnderbird and 43 avenue.
f30DOoIxvoV9btiDvKMTw,59ZTmdu9zHzXURZ2a9MiDQ,4,0,0,0,Food is prepared fresh and flavored are great. Eaten three lunches and all were great. Service is a combined effort  so they on top of any needs.
DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg,q2vaJIvAbl-1fmephTAeiQ,4,0,3,0,I ate at New India Bazaar for dinner. I took it to go. I ordered samosa  pani puri chaat  and gobi. The samosas were very good and very big! The main dish  gobi was really great. As a vegetarian it seemed like I was eating chicken  but it was cauliflower dumplings. The gobi had a comfort food appeal. The pani puri chaat was weird. I've never had it before  so I don't have a comparison. The description sounded yummy  but it just wasn't. The total cost was about $14. I would recommend this restaurant. I noticed that they have a pastry case with desserts. I plan to come back to shop. They  have the best prices that I've seen on neem toothpastes.
w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg,HfcuqsrfQJIJUiHbxGPOvQ,5,0,0,0,Awesome food and service! Really wish we had one in Oahu! Our servers were on it! Thank you for working it out and fitting in our party of 9!
XhUec6kgPy1ZYUrzvPQ,BOzcsr9s5foYKUmMu1Pjqg,2,0,0,0,hi  went to anthonys last thurs. night with a party of seven. We were celebrating an anniversary   we all dressed up to the nines ! ! wanted to have a fun nite out !  the food is good  very high end .  2 of us ordered the prime rib  2 others ordered filet  3 others steak  plus apps of sashimi  tator tots  mashed potatoes   spinach  lobster bisques for all  they do charge extra for everything... so watch out  we sat outside it is a nice view..... now the bad part... our waiter  Fabio. I don't like to be disrespectful to our food servers here in Vegas cuz they do work hard  but Fabio is very rude  rushed us during our ordering  did not want to explain the specials after my uncle asked a question  he said he did not know  did not bring our drinks until after our dinner was served by someone else  he was very rude when we asked for another martini and never brought it. he also did not bring water until we asked four times cuz we passed on the bubbles water  he also tried to take out plates before we were done ! the place was empty  three times he wanted to take my plate with food on it ...jeeeez..... Anthonys please he needs more training on how to treat customers :(
8TBt9XAVZIZR2Y0EqBHskg,UuwV_kvSBEiRD0lbbUWNbg,5,1,1,0,A tale of two locations (AKA: AVOID 7700 S Autoplex  GO TO 616 W Baseline)  First the good: 616 W Baseline  I have been a loyal repeat customer of Cobblestone Auto Spa ever since I encountered Jared  one of the managers at the 616 W Baseline.   The first time I went there I had my car detailed for $150 after discounts. The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.  I am not good with names or dates  but I remember this man's name  because he does his job with pride. After Jared  I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.  COBBLESTONE  PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MorE OF!  Now the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex  I first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide  as just being an off day.  I then went a second time for a wash  also below standard. I also let that slide.  I then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever  but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.  When I pointed out the mess on the dash  initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager  who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.  Finally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage  but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.  I went home  frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.  The next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care  and no effort to clean anything  I discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed  but tossed on the back seat.   I knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties  so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.  I suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.  As a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.  I went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous  and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee.   They reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up  and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.  Jared to the rescue:  I took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem  his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.  Lesson: NEVER GO TO THE 7700 LOCATION! ALWAYS GO TO THE 616 LOCATION!  COBBLESTONE  BAD MANAGERS MAKE For A BAD STAFF. GREAT MANAGERS MAKE For A GREAT STAFF.
9KmvrnyjWTr4sly0Dt770g,-oP2LfLJsXEje1vj_-9eQQ,1,0,0,0,The location was excellent and the restaurant was beautiful. The food was awful and our server was very rude and impolite. We were a group of 6 people and whatever we ordered was worse than another one! Even my little daughter who loves french fries couldn't eat them because they weren't fresh and she thought that they were artificial!!!
SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,INgDq4n1Qj0F1i50EulvPw,5,0,1,0,Juan's is ALWAYS busy because it's ALWAYS good. It's great food  but the excellent  friendly service is what keeps people coming back. I've been here dozens of times...date nights  with family  with kids  girls nights. Always wonderful. Try the shrimp ceviche!

The service was amazing from the time we walked in the door.  We were sat at a table and to our surprise there is a beer and whiskey tap at the table.  You pay by the ounce and there is a screen to show you what you've drank.  The food we had was great.  The whiskey burger was my favorite.  For you country fans this is a must when in Scottsdale!

A4zLP5AyKEEHQrdWEZKig,48a4A2YXYOWrHuA5Lk-eQw,4,0,0,0,I was very skeptical about this spot.  First it's almost impossible to find good authentic legit spots on the Las Vegas strip for exotic cuisines- hispanic  Asian middle eastern  etc. If you want one  go off the strip.   second A place that proudly serves  Middle eastern  and also  Greek  food usually misses those authentic flavors. For example serving Jewish Latkes  Israeli/middle eastern humus  and Greek moussaka is usually just too much for a fusion.   And yet  the food was tasty! Even tough it wasn't 100% loyal to the original flavors or shapes of the Middle East the food was yummy! And I do have to give them a round of applause for their hummus. Simply really good!  The lamb shawarma was also good. And branzino fish with labaneh was on point.   Even though our hostess did a terrible job  our server was lovely.   So bottom line. Worth visiting. A solid 4 stars spot.  Trust me. I know food.
SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,iXh8u9Xup4lUb9-vTe7Pzw,4,7,8,6,We usually go to Lindo Michoacán when we want Mexican at a sit down restaurant  but I felt like we were just there and talked my husband into trying Juan's. Ok  we're hooked! Service was great. We got the Fajitas for 2 with Steak and Chicken  add cheese...so good  lots of flavor. Loved the fideo soup and chips with the onions and peppers  the salsa and bean dip were good although not my favorite. My only other gripe is smelling of fajita when we left  I smelled like I had worked the grill  my clothes were saturated with the smell and my skin felt greasy. I had noticed the smell and cloud of smoke in the restaurant when we sat down. I'll just be sure not to have anything special planned after we eat here. Prices were on par with other Mexican restaurants and you get more than enough to eat. We will definitely be back and we'll be packing the Febreeze!
X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ,awLl8GdM0H3MJImLXsqvlg,4,0,0,0,Service was prompt and good. I ordered the roti canai which was excellent and also filling. The chicken curry for the roti wasn't thick  I think that's a good combination as a dip. I also ordered the lamb curry (I forgot the exact name.. Rendang?) the flavor was good but I didn't like the taste of the meat the chicken or beef version is probably better. The lamb meat I feel tastes like lamb sweat. At least that's what I imagined it to be. I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't satisfied with the lamb meat and some of the items there were a bit pricey. Other than that it's excellent and I like their beverages that they have a grass jelly drink and Malaysian iced tea :). Will definitely come back again next time.
Wxxvi3LZbHNIDwJZimtnA,Rm5rDYHyEwMkk-jAb2qGHg,1,0,0,0,It's extremely annoying that the Venetian chooses to broadcast Fox News at their VIP lounges against their customers' will and employees' will.  I would consider this harassment since neither have a choice to change the channel. I've tried. I have complained to the employees who state they are not able to change the channel. Trust me  the Venetian customers and their employees do not want to be forced to watch Fox News. Please change to a neutral channel or CNN which provides more transparent news.
9Q1ZtzTPFWG4fJiFSko5Xg,TetO8IIvbaaX9xnC7ZE1Rw,5,0,0,0,My boyfriend and I went here for dinner evening and all I can say is it was awesome. Be prepared the drinks are powerful here and we made the mistake of getting Tequila shots on the side..but the frozen Margarita house drinks did not need it. Needless to say we took our time drinking and eating so we could travel home safely. Fantastic time...we will definitely visit this restaurant again... by the way ... I had the chicken shrimp and spinach entree and John had the mahi-mahi tacos... so good!
gp9ZESRRNLqWfgJtEzPThA,1Wmqy1NvEt62EX7VMo4MLw,3,1,5,3,I had the large cheese pizza. While I sat and waited I observed the following. Phones have the most germs on them of almost anything.  The young man grating the cheese played with his smartphone typing out a few messages. Replaced it to his pocket and continued handling the cheese without washing his hands or using any plastic gloves.  The young lady was cleaning dirty tables with a rag  and spray. Not a problem except when she was done she put the spray bottle up and didn't bother washing her hands either and went immediately to handling food items in the back.  Pizza was fine  but barely had enough cheese on it to cover it. Fair for the price.  On a previous visit I had the gyro sandwich. I found it to be very wet and gooey  not much flavor at all to the meat.  My last visit. I will say the pizza prices are fair for what they are offering.   My problem is the lack of being sanitary.
LUN6swQYa4xJKaMUEUOEw,hNO1_hkdUZDkqc-BjDHjrg,5,0,0,0,These guys really are great  easy to work with  and provide a valuable service.  I worked with Sammy to coordinate a night out with 10 girls for a bachelorette party in Vegas.  We decided to go to Tryst.  Sammy was very patient in taking multiple phone calls and answering all my questions  even throwing in a couple of extra perks at my request.  The pre-pay service is great--the company takes the total cost of the evening and divides it per person  creating a link online where each girl can go and pay ahead of time.  We didn't have to deal with a large bill or everyone's credit cards at the end of the night.  It was SO easy.  Someone from the company was in constant contact with me leading up to our night out.  Sammy  knowing how large of a group we had and how important a good table was to us  called me the night of to let me know they'd had a different  better table open up  and that he was giving it to us at no extra charge.    Craig was our host for the evening.  He contacted me promptly to provide detailed instructions on where to meet him and when.  Craig was waiting to greet us and  as promised  walked us right into the club and to our table  which had our bottles  mixers and waitresses waiting.  Craig stopped back a couple of times before leaving to make sure we were settled and having a good time.  I contacted Sammy a couple more times throughout the weekend for various things  and he was more than helpful even though we weren't using them for additional reservations or nights out.    Planning ahead is the way to go when it comes to Vegas  and while I don't think you HAVE to use an outside VIP company to plan  I don't really see a disadvantage to doing so.  I would definitely call Red Carpet VIP again.
I6qFvRjVDGqDDiVG38ng,mbVzxuQTLRPbK-RwoGJsbA,1,0,2,1,Oh man this is going to be a long review so if you want the gist  god awful  do not go. I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish  the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend  and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place  I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.  We walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice  my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool  no big deal  he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet  and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas  the jenni jelly drink  and two waters.    My family waited around  no waters  no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait  our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow  he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat  and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes  our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls  then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before  making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm  it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth  and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate  and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.    In the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food  I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer  they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act  there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.
nZAJ2a2Oyxt6GzX97i2pg,snHJ1r0lIChCdTvtUHHKhA,4,0,0,0,Great wings   and the breakfast is pretty good also .the Cook does a great job on the food . I don't drink so I can't say anything about that but over all a good neighborhood place .
w1clLiXOoyLhNjt5jDBCA,UPQ79Rqc27mKXYGAMRZ6qg,3,1,2,1,Their is a bit of a disconnect from the moment you arrive in the parking lot as the signage makes a cool  sophisticated impression that does not match the semi-bland interior. This could be any of the relatively higher chain restos that feels like it needs an update but maybe that's just me?  The food is the thing in any restaurant and pretty much everything was just ok. Our salesman/server;) confidently stated the steak tacos were the best menu item  and they were  but still only rated a just above average 3.5.  I had a ribeye with mashed and seasonal vegetables that was not coked to medium as requested (who knows why they ask in spots like this because it is pretty much never done right?). The accompanying sauce was actually very good and that saved this dish for me.  If Union Social was located closer to where we live it might merit another chance but we live in the south end of Mississauga and thus will be sticking closer to home.

Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served.   Management provided a friendly compensation  but I don't want anyone to get poisoned  sooo yeah  eat at your own risk!!
uwpPniaFEVkK5TPWdQZ0A,TBsDehtdQAdt0UClVrRE1A,4,0,0,0,The challah French toast paired with turkey bacon was a pretty awesome breakfast and I thoroughly enjoyed it; however  I felt the staff was lacking in service. They were very nice  just not very prompt and would disappear for quite some time.  I don't know if it was because a few people called out and they were short-staffed or if one should plan to stay awhile.  The food is very good  though.
4X9tVVQHIewliXqaancfQA,EAk4jcLyj2s9R5AnRMpfpA,1,0,0,0,Awful. Nearly inedible... even for airport food.  Don't push the  prompt service  button on the table. The waitress said that they ignore it.  Keep walking.

D5aSQhj3uyX4Fj1B31EYRQ,Y-KtijRX7iwjJWK9B48Ggg,1,2,18,1,This is for service only.  On a 2000 Honda Accord Vtec EX.  Had major service done here: 1. timing belt  water pump  tune up  etc.  Basically everything that was recommended and told needed to be done.  Wanted the car to be reliable and not have any issues so I went ahead with all the required maintenance and then some.  1 month after all this major service the radiator blew open coming back from flagstaff.....Ok so I understand things break etc.  I take it to Arrowhead Honda Service and the explanation was since I replaced the water pump with a new one it must have increased pressure in the system. Since the radiator was old the new water pump found a weakness in the radiator.  I was then told it was common??? OK I get the explanation  but if that was the case a month a go and common knowledge why not recommend replacing the radiator with the major service so the car would not leave me stranded???  They also had recommended the power steering pump be replaced  system flushed etc.  Hate when its not done right the first time?  Had to bring it back and wait for them to get air out of the system so the new power steering pump would stop making noise.    I went to this dealership service department because they know Honda's better then me and what breaks  unfortunately even when I changed everything they initially recommended they still missed other items that should of been changed.  I have not been back since this mistake....

RI7jH14rISeIa2Idvuyh8A,c4t3x4G2goB2OuqrEiBzJA,5,0,0,0,I love this location. Christina was our server this morning and she was fantastic. As a former waitress I understand how hectic and overwhelming a morning shift can get but she was attentive and very friendly and always kept her cool even with the tons of tables she had.   The food was brought to us within ten minutes of ordering (successfully taming the hangry beast that was brewing) and any modification to our order was done correctly! The food itself was pretty good.  -- I highly recommend the banana nutella crepes.   Overall I was very impressed with this recent visit. Keep up the good work!
7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,JO1EOjDfMdvC2Vrw5P-Baw,3,0,1,0,The service was pretty bad. There were these two grouchy ladies dealing with us at the entrance and we have to wait ridiculously long for a table even though the restaurant is almost empty. Then we have to sit as far away from the food as possible. When we ask to sit closer they say no. We ask why and they say no one is covering that area. Seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception  I mean its a buffet. we won't be needing much service if any.   Luckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas.   The food at the buffet was one of the better buffets I've had in Vegas  definitely better than Monte Carlo's or Harrah's  but nothing compared to Paris or Mirage. I was told Caesar's Palace is the best  but I've never had it. From the looks of it  I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas.   One really cool feature here is the salad bar  where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets  though the execution of them aren't so great.   Definitely worth going to for the food  but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back  but I wouldn't tell people not to go.
R1jJQi2yR44D2ileqr8kA,XqFb2c5I4l8Q5SmQ30datA,5,0,0,0,My companion and I went to Living Kitchen on an impulse and am very happy to say it was delicious and worth it! My companion got the Arugula Harvest salad and I got the Pad Thai. The Arugula Harvest salad was very tasty and all of the components came together well. The Pad Thai was also very flavorful and had an awesome sauce which had a good afterburn to it. I would highly recommend coming here to try the food vegan  vegetarian  or otherwise.

You can tell the veggies are fresh just by looking at them. The gyro was one of the best I've had and the fries were awesome. Great service! They really care about giving you a good experience. I will definitely be back!

XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4qDw,8QXoOgBimlXyRl0ISMXfGg,4,3,1,0,Better than hot & juicy and boiling crab.. They would have gotten 5 starts from me  but they forgot my crab legs! The main reason I wanted to come here.. It was disappointing  but the flavors are really good and the seafood was very fresh.. I love that they use real butter in the sauce and not margarine like all the other crawfish spots!! So this will be my new seafood spot..
Wxxvi3LZbHNIDwJZimtnA,9XiyPxxdlJgNhkD8ghG3Uw,5,0,1,0,The nicest hotel I've ever stayed in in Vegas! Found a great deal during the week and couldn't pass it up.

pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA,pCbyWYtW1kmrz-nV1irddA,5,0,0,0,A wonderful dinner experience! Hubby and I came couple months ago  it was our first time at Sushi Samba. We didn't have reservations  but they were able to seat us at the sushi bar.  We had the A5 Wagyu gyoza  was tender and not overdone  Tuna tataki  Chicken Samba was a good size portion  El topo roll  chef sashimi selections  and Tonkotsu ramen. Everything we order was super yummy!  Definitely coming back again next time we're in town!! I would recommend making reservations next time  the sushi bar is kind of tight and if you order a good amount of food  not too much room.
qpBfYbkPmXIFWVQ7pLkQw,EV1I5ZH8Q6wt0LNtUiSHoA,5,0,1,0,Danielle was the perfect server - always smiling and came around enough but not too much  made good suggestions and generally let us be silly  nearby table neighbors were great  food was fresh and tasty. I had the crab topped chicken which was juicy and flavorful. The man had ravioli something that was also tasty - fresh pasta and good meat sauce.   The salad and soup and breadsticks are always wonderful. We also got the bruschetta which was really perfect - not specialty  not gourmet  just perfectly normal  fresh tasting tomato  basil and olive oil yumminess.  We also had a trio of their Dolcini desserts which made it perfect so we could have tiramisu and the limoncello and strawberry stuff!  Overall  even though it was really busy and we waited for about 20 minutes for a table (although 'waiting' in the bar having a drink hardly counts as waiting)  with the excellent service and great food this place definitely gets 5 stars from me and for a chain restaurant that is definitely something!
Ak08F6RqjHYmVCzweBbTrQ,#NAME?,1,0,1,1,I'm truly disgusted by the service of this restaurant.  I came in with my family (Mom and Dad) and they said 10 minute wait  we said okay  we notice that they were short with their staff so we waited patiently till we were seated at a table  but that 10 minutes turned into a 30min wait. So the hostess sat us at a table saying how there may be awhile wait  after seeing 2 servers walk by us like we didn't exist  the hostess later seated another table which were 4 Caucasian customers  we were still patiently waited for around another 30min  when those 4 sat down an Asian waiter quickly came to take their order  I got the waiters attention and said excuse me  we came here first. And she made up an excuse saying how  Oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy  I knew this was an excuse  I was so disgusted. So we told the hostess that this waiter is waiting on a table after us  and she said oh well we said there would probably be a long wait  and the hostess had the audacity to say  Oh but they serve the people who come before  and I said  we were before them  we been waiting 30min at this table and you know this because you sat us at our table  she said it depends. So in the end we left the restaurant hungry and went to a much better restaurant which served us very well  called Rice Paper.

Since this was our first time visiting this place  the staff was very patient and helped guide us. When we went to go check out which ones to print  Agent Collins was a great help. We loved his easy going personality and he has great customer service! 10/10 would visit again. The pics came out very nice too! Thank you  Agent Collins. Continue to show your awesome personality and great customer service! Very much appreciated.
1HD5iUUfVJDbfEBIn9yVhw,WPQ878enfx0FWlgnmT3F4w,3,0,0,0,I used to come here a lot. It was the best boba place around here but lately the tea just taste like water  sugar  and flavor. There is no tea taste but the texture of boba is good.  The squid balls are still great. But I guess if you like slush and blended drinks its still good. I will still come because its the closest by my house.
o1dX8oFupfjbBpYgT7TH0w,3qwgrPW0hOaWi8R4FYQMBw,3,1,5,1,This show was fun  but i was expecting more from all the hype it gets. We picked this over Chippendales cuz the idea of Australian men with their accents is so much hotter than American dancers =P. When I called in to purchase tickets an hour before the show  they said that they didn't have a table to fit 5 girls  and that we would have to separate into two tables  which was fine. But when we got there  there was 2 completely empty tables in the front of the stage! The sales people were really unorganized to not notice that was available! So we ditched our booth and went straight to the front table  which gave a much better view.  The show was def entertaining  with finely sculpted men ripping off their shirts and dressing up in firemen/spartan outfits ;) The occasional view of g-strings was not as welcome  something about a man in a g-string is just wrong  you know? but nonetheless  it was very entertaining. The emcee's accent was hot  and so was his bod. i think i found him the most attractive out of all the guys. They pulled a lot of the bachelorettes and birthday girls onstage to participate  and some of the older women too  which i thought was cool. They also ran around through the audience as well  so no matter where your seats were  I think you'd be able to get up close with one of the guys.  Downside though  at the end of the show  you are welcome to go to the front of the stage and pay $20 PER PERSON to take a pic with the guys  only to receive one picture. no offense  but that is a total rip off. i've been to Fantasy  which is a female stripshow   and you can take pics with them for free  and they had much better attitudes and were a lot friendlier to talk to after the show. They were annoyed that we had stood in like and decided against taking the picture after the show  and even more annoyed when a girl behind us asked if they took credit card. wtf? These men seemed way too jaded and full of themselves. They may be good to look at  but off-stage they're total jerks.  Was this a good show? It was ok  it was entertaining and interactive  which i thought was nice. would i go again though? probably not. Next time  i'm trying chippendales. maybe their attitudes will be better.
Wxxvi3LZbHNIDwJZimtnA,qanp3i2J7ujsDw4k7xxAHg,4,0,1,0,Absolutely no complaints! Stayed in the Bella Suite with a view. It was a fantastic room; amazing service and friendly staff. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is room service.  Yeah yeah I know and can expect to pay higher prices for room service food  but $34 for hot tea and doughnuts (OUCH!) They charge $5 for room service  but I think that should be free.

Ux3Ryer88VwUlqa71Npg,CaH7RjgOkiIjrOx_gF2A9g,5,0,1,0,This Pita Jungle is located in the food court at the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall. Out of all the eateries in the food court  this is by far and away the healthiest. There are some vegetarian and vegan options for those looking for a meat-free dish. The lentil soup is super yum and they have some great dishes I haven't seen anywhere else. They have several locations in the valley. The one on Ray and Dobson has a patio right next to a small lake. It's a great location  but can get crazy busy  especially during lunch on the weekends or on gorgeous days.
8mIrXLrOnAqWsB5JrOojQ,MazZLjEBHtvfaZ9zo6beXw,4,0,0,0,This is a really quaint place for the whole family!  Rows of pinball machines- some vintage  some modern. There are also other various arcade games like Super Mario Bros. and Centipede.  Crane games for all your plushie needs.  Coin machines to turn your bills into coins for the machines.  Vending machines in case you are feeling hungry or thirsty while you play.  Staff walks around to make sure machines are running as they should and refund you if one of them fails while you are playing.  Towards the back  there are more older pinball machines that seem to be out of order or in the process of restoration.. really neat to see!  I believe there is also a prize counter in the back though I'm not sure how that would work.  It is a dimly lit building which allows the lights of the machines to illuminate the area.. Great place to hang out and play some good ol' fashioned arcade games.
dLrfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow,sdQWECjMdRmQ2vNf6461Ug,2,0,0,0,I understand Las Vegas is over-priced.  But $50 for a pitcher of mediocre sangria - more than 1/2 way filled with ice - with not a slice of fruit in sight?  ANNOYING.    Friendly staff.  My food (fish tacos) was not nearly as good as the time I had it before.    It is conveniently located very close to the convention center so it gets packed when events are going on.
HTaA1mo9cB1dXMwfJC6yKg,cZtU2vU4ZuESHMaOK4VOCQ,5,0,0,0,Love coming back to this location  one of the best ones I've been to. Have tried other buffalo's and they don't top the service from the metro center store. We always get helped out by Chelsea and she is awesome always has a smile and makes us feel at home  also the team captains are always checking to see if we are good with our orders and drinks
oj8qk3W7O9oq15VIsvYJQ,7OZuvmg7aQvG8gJrYuraUA,2,0,4,0,Looked forward to eating here for so long...too bad it was on my birthday - food was good but the service was deplorable so not going to rehash this too much (apologies to my man and bro as I know they were also hoping for better)  The appetizers were by far the best thing - the entree's were good with red meat being the star.  Peach cobbler desert was all topping that I swear was merely microwaved and had one slice of grilled peach - putting a candle on it did nothing to make me think this was the birthday dessert I was for...   I highly recommend the flight of 10  20 30 & 40 yr old ports - this mellowed out the complete waste of skin that was our server. Not sure if he thought we looked unable to tip for a spendy bill or weren't as enthralled as the table next to us with his Montana stories but my brother aptly reconfirmed his tip expectation with 7% - too much in my opinion for not giving diddley about someone chosing their restaurant to celebrate in.
0BW6higJinzbqcprYUaQ,h0rm2tjfYz_TEZEmmE0Uvg,4,2,3,1,Hy Steakhouse is a contemporary and elegant  traditional steak house  with lots of open space and an intimate dinning experience.  We started with the Famous Cheese Toast  oyster rockerfeller which was 6  sweet and savory but very small oysters.  And the beef tartare  which was made table side and served with small biscuits.  We ended off with the 22 oz. porterhouse steak  which was cooked perfectly to order and was more than enough for the both of us.  Our server was friendly and insightful  and always catered to our needs at the table  other servers were also helpful but tended to their own tables. Although there were several mistakes on our bill initially  such as wrong food and drinks and extra items being billed  our server fixed everything easily.  The room itself was dimmed and the ambiance was more intimate.  In conclusion  the food quality is above standard  service and cleanliness is high  and the atmosphere is intimate. The food is more old fashioned  come here for a great steak done right at a slightly higher price range than the keg.

Highly recommend this spot!!!
yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,Tv87VbmTrCVlGukNUvdAsQ,4,1,1,0,Battista's Hole In the Wall is awesome! Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.  It's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying  so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself  but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly  local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us)  we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal  since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends  but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though  plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad  garlic bread  pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread  but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.  Service was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two  to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again.

GHUHWAaVjKDn74r50EKKMA,kKYoJIofGkSmtuCDgq0Lmg,2,0,1,0,I should have listened at the other reviews for this place. I got the Hopeful Signature Poke Bowl and it was very bland  and didn't quite sit right in my stomach. Maybe too much sauce? It is comparable to  having salmon sushi ingredients in a bowl with way too much rice. It's too bad  because I love poke bowls and had high hopes for this place. 2 stars for the nice interior.
FvVSy2r7zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,ENklIEls1kIGLFPkUSWIjQ,4,2,2,3,I have a confession to make... I have an obsession with tongue.  That's right folks - tongue. I love it. Name the animal - duck  pig  cow - it's definitely one of the best eating parts of the animal. (what  were thinking about something else? You guys have dirty minds ;P  !) Being Asian  my parents indoctrined this love at a very early age.  When I discovered that Jewish delis were into tongue too (and liver  yum!)  I pretty much loved hitting up inexpensive places to nosh.  I was kind of depressed in Vegas because... well  on the Strip  you pass by all these famous delis that basically rape your wallet.  You can imagine how happy I was to find the Bagel Cafe!   My hubby got the pastrami and I ordered the tongue sandwich. Perfection. Really. And not hard on the wallet either which is the best part.  I did try a slice of Boston Creme cake and it is totally junky good.
uczILVmOHqosb7XZeDSlOw,W1lZ68PtJu3DF_QAyTmSWA,5,1,1,0,Interior is super cool and chill & the place has numerous decorative pieces if you look carefully.

qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,zMBaVXF-cTZ_DEwO_09YaA,4,0,0,0,I have been to Vintner Grill twice in two weeks recently.  The first was on Administrative Professionals' Day for lunch.  It was packed and the food was delicious.  As is the usual with Vintner  the service was not great.  Our waiter was friendly (when we saw him)  but he just couldn't keep up in his section.  Hubby and I also went back on a Friday at 2:15 for a liquor lunch  and I must say it was one of the best dining experiences we have had in Las Vegas.  The food was excellent as it has always been.  However  for the first time  the service (by Mark)  was impeccable.  Was it because there were only a few tables?  Possibly  but something tells me that I have found my go-to server from now on.  He made great recommendations  and the timing of everything was amazing.  Sitting outside and enjoying champagne was heavenly.  Please go to Vintner Grill.  It is worth the drive from the Strip.  Just be patient in case the service is a little slow.  Besides  you never know what celebrity you may see!

I will be using them again and again for as long as I live when I come to Vegas.  All their staff is great with email or phone correspondence  thank you Annie!!  You cannot go wrong with them.  Shell out the extra dough and book your Vegas clubbing experience  you wont be disappointed.
RBAcL6hg2yoaTRv0kKUjPA,tcj5qLOW8iS5QeNIFclH_Q,5,1,0,0,I am never disappointed with this place. I've yet to eat at the restaurant but the ahi bar is amazing! I always come in to get the spicy ahi bowl and a few sides of ahi. So yummy!
cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGbA,ljyWWUY5WHa5iOweyvYsPA,5,2,2,2,A must go destination in Phoenix. Chinese - Mexican - Jamaican Fusion Fast Casual (or as I like to call it - Confusion!) It's a Phoenix original.  It's been on Diner's Dives and Drive Ins.  If it's your first time  go up to the counter (to the left of the cash registers) and ask for the orientation - they'll walk you through the ordering process  and give you samples of several of the dishes.  After you do that  grab an order form and pick a 2 item combo and choose 7 9 Black and White.  That's all your really need to know.  :-)  That's Jade Red Chicken  Jerk Chicken  Black Beans and White Rice.  Jade Red Chicken is sort of their take on sweet and sour  but with a spicy twist.  Jerk Chicken is Jamaican influenced (and can be quite spicy some days).  The Black Beans are amazing - stir them into your rice (easier to eat both with your chopsticks when you do this).  And  did I mention  you get a snickerdoodle with your order?  Yep!  Best snickerdoodles around  and one comes with every dish!  If you haven't been to Chino's - it's time - make a run for the border/great wall/beach! (and make sure to read the non-PC T-shirts while you wait - funny!)

I even decided to join their wellness program because it's very accommodating and manageable for my expenses.

The kids love the chipotle chicken flatbread and I am addicted to the Moroccan gazpacho! We feel great when we leave and usually try make better food choices for the rest of the day!
ALwAlxItASeEs2vYAeLXHA,RyYkInYjgpdXTcDj8syO0Q,3,0,1,0,I'm not sure what's happened to Futo Buta  but the past couple times we've come it just hasn't been the same.  We've received dirty utensils and the ramen just isn't as good.  Recently took some family over and the food was bland and overly fatty.  I really do hope that it gets back on track because this was one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte!
3uIXuw878fNjxZ2Li1diFg,#NAME?,3,0,0,0,Place was okay... Sangria I has was watery & unflavorful  but got me buzzed. That was part of the point of the drink  but I like a craftily concocted cocktail or elixir & this one was not.  But  (I'm using a lot of buts...) the unchicken & waffles was quite okay. They used veggie meat & they did quite a good job making it like chicken. Since I can't do Roscoe's cause I'm a veggie  this spot did the trick. If Roscoe's was in Europe it would be a different story...  It hit the spot. Came with sweet potato mash and collard greens on the side. It was all super healthy. No crazy amounts of butter or oil. Yet  it tasted amazing. But it definitely could have used a side of syrup. What was on there wasn't nearly sufficient enough.  The atmosphere was not to my liking. Very cafe-like and crowded.  But it's an alright spot. I may or may not go back.

SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,bMQPELbOG7Y1QWtd9E9U5w,5,5,4,4,Fajitas on Fire.  5 beers in a bucket for $15. Good chips and Salsa.  Mariachi Band.  Strategic TV's for all seats.  Excellent Margaritas. Kid friendly. This place rocks!!!  Out of all the places in Las Vegas to pick for Cinco de Mayo food  drinks  and music  we picked this one based on YELP reviews.  We were first time visitors.  We will definitely return very soon!    We arrived early to avoid long waits and drunk people.  By the time we left  we might have been the very people we were trying to avoid!  Drinks aside  we enjoyed the flaming fajitas!  We ordered the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp.  It is more than enough for 2 people.  My hubs and I made 7 fajitas from the meat.  We can't speak to any of the other food.  OH WAIT!  Now I remember  we had an AMAZING desert.  A sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries.  It was DELISH!!    We met Juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler.  Juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily Happy Hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town.  Their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good!   Our server was very friendly and the service was great!  The Mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again.  They were very good!    This is a place worth visiting!  Good food  good drinks  good prices  and good service!  Locally owned.  Flaming Fajitas - what more can you ask for!!!
jG1jcAeDw0pZTHCNC5kww,4NL8FKyKRFR8WH9TuoOmNg,4,0,2,0,After a day of shopping at the local mall and with dinner still hours off  a friend and I popped into Grazie (based on a recommendation from a former Phoenix resident) for a snack.  Didn't hurt that my hotel was just up the street.  After a quick review of the menu  pizza seemed the best option and settled on the Capricciosa (Tomato Sauce  Mozzarella  Artichokes  Olives  Mushrooms  Salame  Ham  Parmigiano Reggian).  The pie emerged from the wood fire oven piping hot  with a slightly burnt crust.  It lasted approximately 5 minutes before vanishing into our hungry bellies.    Wine list is all-Italian and well priced  with many by the glass selections.  I opted for a nice Barbera  which was poured generously into a large glass.  I'd be a regular if living in the area.
qfj5Ih86RPF2ccvNGvCcg,ZRigHl3KyvIYgCr-7toWig,3,0,1,0,Came in with my girl at 8:05 on Tuesday  store closes at 9pm screen cracked on iphone6+  phone works great just a little fuzzy on front camera.  She has Apple care insurance plan  7  apple professionals  there 3 helping customers  4 standing around.  Approached one saying she would like a new phone   professional  said there's no need for a new phone  just a new screen  unfortunately you don't have an appointment and there is no appointments available until Friday   so we can set something up for you then.  So we thought to ourselves what about the other 4  professionals  doing? So my girl said I just want a new phone. The  professional  said well if the screen is just cracked there is no need for a new phone  so we can make that appointment for Friday. At this point one guy did say that he wasn't doing anything and could do it  but we just wanted a new phone. So we had to be a bit rude and insist several times that we just wanted a new phone because we wanted it now.  Finally they relented and got the phone and our the door at 8:35.  A little to uppity attitude.
vxadNrpTY7OHNmWsrEpNnA,3wzCerhnR5O6OUGE32p0rw,5,0,0,0,Listen people this is the spot. Stop paying too much at over priced place where the portions are small and mash potatoes are green. This place portion size it meant to feed a horse not a mouse like the other places. Like I'm coming back here over and over again. Plus my gf lives not far is its convenient.
wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw,#NAME?,4,0,1,0,Had a fantastic experience dining at Olive & Ivy! Believe it or not  we even thoroughly enjoyed dining outside in the August Scottsdale swelter- their misting system works amazingly well.  Went with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings  the cozy decor  the lighting  and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp  we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true  they are totally fabulous- not to be missed!   I had chicken scaloppini  which was delicious- perfectly prepared  and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about  and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate!   The focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful  and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state  which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced. We were celebrating one of my daughter's friend's birthdays  so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an  ice cream bar   which had ice cream  marshmallow  and lots of rich  luscious chocolate. It was totally delicious  and reminded us of a s'more.  Olive & Ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront  and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in Europe. I will definitely be back- only wish we had an Olive & Ivy in Tucson!
yNPh5SO7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ,OED6UmN9WWtBrGCfpokffg,3,6,11,4,This is a tricky one. AB is a really cool looking spot  really nice decor and ambiance  comfy booths  it even smells like a new car.  My group was greeted promptly by smiling hosts  and seated in a nice booth. Drink orders were placed  and when our margaritas arrived  they were really  really off and tasted terrible. Even after stirring  and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough  and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz  and it was perfect. Highly recommended.  For an app we went with the pretzel fondue  thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised  it was delicious  and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips  and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty  but the price point  for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries  along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again  the food was good  but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions  euro style  etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything  but either bump up portion size  or drop the price from $16 to $11.50.  I really liked our server  but for some reason as things went on  he was more and more absent. To be fair  we had a really difficult person that joined us  some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out  so I feel his pain.  Anyway  AB is a very attractive spot that might be great for drinks and app. but for this price point  I would hit Durant's  Hillstone  or Beckett's Table. It's nice to leave a spot feeling that you got your monies worth  and that just doesn't happen here.
vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,oEh_JBYy6DDpk4PpWuR-Gg,4,1,0,0,Ping Pang Pong has always been an outstanding choice in terms of Chinese food here in the valley. What is so surprising is that most Chinese restaurants inside the hotels & casinos really are sub-par. The very basic essence of clean  fresh and friendly is the definition here  and the food is quite authentic. The servers work quite hard and there is a decent presence of managenent staff to ensure smooth operations. The XO sauce is very tasty  but be careful if you order it on the side as they will charge you for it (not exactly cheap). Still  I have been quite pleased with the food & service upon every visit for a number of years now. Definitely recommend -
lywduRzRWrZLD03L2ZINhQ,npXfo6gb0OpE-i53e85f9w,1,0,0,0,I didn't listen to the low reviews  I wish I did. Literally the worst. We went through two of their routers that both broke. One didn't get us anywhere near the speed we were paying for  I called and chatted with multiple people before we could get a replacement router. Finally got the replacement and things seemed okay  but no  it completely broke in less than a month. It won't even turn on anymore. They suggested we go buy a new router from Best Buy  who btw doesn't sell dsl routers anymore wtf!? They charge you ridiculous shipping prices for the replacement for their item that doesn't work properly! Every time you chat with them you get different answers and they transfer you to about 10 people before they even get close to answering your question.  Do not use this service  it might be cheaper but not cheap enough to deal with all this BS they put you though.
d8lmIZIqmBC9oPM8y1dc7Q,O_w2fnNmG-zJcbN8ft5DAw,5,0,1,0,Paco's Tacos is the real deal! In spite of the great Yelp reviews  I still had my reservations about eating at another TexMex chain. How good could it be I thought? Well they totally nailed it  from the complementary chips and dip to the sauce stains on my napkin!  The dining area was empty and only a few people were at the bar upon my arrival for a late lunch. Adlai our server was very helpful with recommendations and was knowledgeable of the menu. I had a overstuffed grilled chicken taco which arrived with Mexican rice  mixed cabbage coleslaw and  their own  Charro style pintos  all at the incredible price of... drum roll please... 7 Bucks! My buddy tried Paco's Taco which is shredded beef and was equally as tasty. Servings are huge and everything was fantastic.   Premeal chips and salsa were delivered to the table immediately. The chips are very thin and were very fresh. The place was clean and attractive. Sanitation rating was a 95. For those long time Charlotteans like myself  you may remember this place as the old Manzetti's.  I'm going back soon! This place is a Gotta Try!.

The mushroom ravioli appetizer is special  the tuna as well...The decor is nice and makes this place a nice one for 'special' dinners. As others have mentioned it is pricey with a good tip for good service we were at $185 for two appetizers  two sides  two steaks and one glass of wine... hummm....
YLqO9xm5s0KJ9JzWukAk8Q,Sj04gotp3O_C-T9thsXgaQ,4,2,4,1,We used to come pretty frequently when it was Joey's. When they changed over to North and South  we were a bit apprehensive about the addition of bbq and stayed away. It took a Yelp event to introduce us to the owners and the ways and whys of North and South. It was great  talking with them about what's new and learning about the cooking processes. We decided to try it out again after tasting their amazing St Louis ribs. We loved eating the ribs so much  I wanted to get a smoker. But why bother  when you can save time by ordering by the pound! I've never been much of a ribs person  but the entire family goes ga-ga over the ribs. It's like a  don't you dare touch my leftovers  kinda feeling after eating here. The waitress/hostess we had was pretty awesome too. Her positive attitude and the info she provided about menu items made it a comfortable environment for us. We'll be back!
Wxxvi3LZbHNIDwJZimtnA,ERaMldEgoQRVkhQtR8viGg,5,0,0,0,i did not stay at this hotel but i did visit the hotel and the shops. Beautiful place!!!! not too crowded  very quiet and peaceful... I love this place. This hotel is located on the strip on the north end.. It's less crowded on the north and there is a mall right across the street. This hotel has many high end stores for shopping such as LV  Cartier  etc  but there is a regular mall across the street with Macy's  forever 21  etc..  The gondola rides are nice  but short!! it's 19.95 a person and it's 10mins long. They can stay in doors and out doors with the gondola. I heard out door is better at night because of the lights. Great overall experience  wonderful restaurants  awesome shops..
QCUjHPu7OFbqfjnehlQaQ,M9tVTKPyPverUeDdnsJQZw,2,0,2,3,Maybe because it was rainy outside  or the bartendress was on the rag  but the service I experienced was ATROCIOUS. This is after only my second experience here. My first experience was in the summer where I hung around the bar (on the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat on) and things were pretty cheery.  This time I ordered from the happy hour menu & apparently when you do this  you must sit at the bar---lame. The bartendress was in a super bitchy mood and poked fun at the fact that I was ordering from the happy hour menu. HELLO? We're not all snobby rich middle-aged Myers Park folk. I prefer beer & I wanted some Olde Mecklenburg Brewery Mecktoberfest  but the bartendress convinces me it isn't good because it's the last of the keg. Great. Personally  I don't do cheap beer  and nothing else looked good  so I stuck with water. At this  she snickers   so just water and some apps.....MMMKAYY  while giving stink eyes. Excuse me? Who pissed in your cornflakes  lady?   Eventually the order comes in: Risotto fritters  Gouda grilled cheese and tomato fondue  koby beef sliders  weird salmon dip. All that was pretty good  no complaints there. This was the whole reason I came in the first place.  NEEDLESS TO SAY I LEFT A GOOD TIP BECAUSE I'M THAT KIND OF A GUY. But honestly  this woman did not deserve one stinking penny  and I'll probably never go back here because of her attitude. It's sad to say because I live in this neighborhood and I like supporting this neighborhood's businesses.   I work with all sorts of people on a daily basis  and work for tips myself  and it benefits no one when you bring your foul mood to the table  in fact it only detracts from possible future business.
q2KtxnPa6rPSpAlMbg9l8g,cYyE6CHzwJkDD6wukfit0A,2,0,12,1,I loved my little cake  but the owner is her own worst enemy to her business. A friend took me there because we went on a cupcake tasting that day. He said a better product was awaiting me as the grand finale. When I walked in the store  I didn't know who the owner was  until my friend pointed it out when we left. I wanted to take a look around  it was nicely decorated  but I could clearly see the person in charge slightly annoyed that I wanted to browse before buying. I explained it my first time at the store and she pushed me to buy a large cake. I explained again that I was not from Scottsdale and am only one person. So I'm not going to buy a large cake. When we started talking a bit more  I could see her employees sort of clam up. I had no idea what was going on. When I chose my little cake  any sort of customer service went out the window once the money transaction occurred.  She didn't even say   Thank you   It was so unusual for a bakery or any business dealing with customers. I was upset and quite frankly  so angry that I wanted to turn around an return my cake and tell the owner to keep my money. I am not rich - I am passionate about bakeries and tour around when I'm in a new town to support local business. I was genuinely interested in hearing about the seasonal cake that she was trying to sell me. I had heard through other locals that they love the cakes  but not the owner when she's in the shop because she's so rude. I give this a two stars because I liked the cakes  but the service was very  very caustic that I could not justify scoring more. She cuts people off  - that was feedback I had received from previous customers. My local friends said that they cannot build rapport with the service workers there because there is always a new person. That made me wonder what was going on. I was trying to figure out how she stayed in business  but then heard she has a contract that keeps her afloat to sell cakes to a prominent medical clinic. I love the cakes there - the store is creative  but I sense a level of stress that turned me off. If it's the economy  that's one thing  but in the U.S.  customer service is not taken lightly and I will probably seek out another Nothing Bundt Cakes for the product  but not return due to the principle of how rude the service was.
qHQPvp6pZ75fB63kOKUPqg,SVOxLL37tIeTzPEukht18g,5,0,0,0,I had two different experiences with Carpet Monkey. In both instances the person who came to clean was on time and it was easy to get a hold of the company when I needed to. Also  they call around 15-30 minutes beforehand to let you know they are on the way. This is a great help since I had to drive 45 minutes to meet them so it was nice knowing how far they were. Their price was also quite good since I requested 4 rooms upstairs  hallway  stairs  and downstairs bedroom. Now the first experience I had was on 09/15. The person who came to clean was Mark. I was not satisfied at all with his work. He didn't clean a good 2 inches from the walls around the whole perimeter of the house. The stairs looked worse than before he came. There were soo many stains that he said should come out that were still there and the carpet was extra crunchy after it dried. Any time we tried to mention something to him we would always get the same response that he's been doing this for 28 or 30 years and wouldn't really listen to our concern. In a normal situation that would warrant an instant 1 star review since I chose this company based on over 500 positive reviews and the pictures seemed great. The work I had gotten done on 09/15 was not anywhere near what the pictures looked like. However instead of rushing to yelp I figured this company doesn't have 500 plus good reviews for nothing and called them up around 09/20. This is where I can really appreciate this company's commitment to customers. When I called I believe the owner picked up. If I remember correctly his name was Rick. I told him everything that happened and he was very cooperative about the fact that I wasn't satisfied at all with Mark's work. He said he'll send his right hand man Joe out and we were quickly able to schedule for 09/22. Again communication is very easy with this company. On top of that Rick told me the second visit wouldn't be of charge. So Saturday comes and we get a phone call from Isaac saying he's on his way  again great communication. I didn't worry too much that it wasn't Joe at our door like I was told since Isaac seemed like he knew what to do in these situations where the previous work wasn't satisfactory. He let me show him where I wasn't satisfied and could see where and why some of the stains didn't come out and said he'll go over all the areas. I was surprised since I thought he'd just go over the areas with spots only. But he went over everything all over again and everything looked A LOT better. The stairs actually looked like they had been cleaned this time and Isaac also went ahead and did the risers which I wasn't expecting. There were some stains that wouldn't come out but he had mentioned that to us. Overall his work actually resembled some of the yelp pictures and the carpets weren't nearly as crunchy when dried after Isaac went over them. He also put the corner protectors on the wall which I appreciated (something Mark didn't do). So my first experience was not good at all but the company was quick to help resolve the issue and reiterated how they wanted the customer to be happy and would do whatever they could to ensure that. This alone earns praise from me since it shows they care enough to at least try and make things better. Second experience with Isaac was WAY better and communication with the company is a breeze. Thank you Isaac and Rick!

I4EmpNOW7zCcx7fUnQ9ixg,6ANp9mICQhti6LzssKGrGA,5,0,1,0,This is my new favorite restaurant in Surprise  which isn't very hard to do because surprise is full of nasty chain restaurants. However  if you want to eat some darn good vietnamese food  this is the place. The pho of any type is amazing  even to go. Also try the spring rolls. Make sure you wrap them in the lettuce with a bit of mint  the texture is bomb fool! It gets a little crowded around 6pm because all of Sun City eats dinner around that time. So show up around 7pm and you'll be fine.
6xgcHeLadVaoTIQewK84A,q2gNL2WmIypxUrf34VCi5w,5,0,0,0,Great steak. Great service. Cool venue. Although it's died down a bit  this place is still always on my radar for good food.
C2T7ecxqsVu99PhSqT3c3g,SEp8BPH_GNO0NyG0r2-PdA,5,0,0,0,Oh my gosh.. BOMBBBBBBBB!!! This place is so amazing!! The food is incredible! I have had almost everything on the menu. They have milk shake happy hour every day between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. with half price milkshakes. The first time you go in  tell them its your first time and they will give you a sample of all of their different sauces. My two favorite are sweet heat and creamy garlic. The staff is incredibly friendly and personable. The restaurant is clean and the hand washing station is pretty neat. Go check it out you will not be disappointed!
Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,QHx3qIhwEzDgL_Whn58SvQ,5,1,1,0,I have eaten at Pan Asian about 15+ times  and have taken several friends here.   I give it 5 stars because the food is insanely good. How anyone can give the food less than 5 stars is beyond me. I am a food critic and have eaten at hundreds of restaurants. Pan Asian is up there of one of my all time favorites. How anyone can give this place less than 4 stars is beyond me. There are always going to be those negative nellys that only look for what they can complain about.   I give the space and decor 4/5 stars - it is small and decor is minimal  but it works.   Miso Soup  Massaman Curry  Basil Fried Rice  and a Thai Iced Tea  is my fav at the moment and what I wish I was eating right now...
u2Z7wvTpZJzQEhfFBS06g,GlcfY0-0FJfT80x6UBFBqA,1,0,0,1,If you can avoid this company  I recommend you do so. They are in the midst of overcharging me $100 for nothing  and insist I have to prove I don't owe it by going to their inconveniently located offices. They won't take a letter or FAX. Rude on the phone to me.  You have to watch them every month  as we have had other bills that were inaccurate (overbilling us) before  too. NO  I do not recommend.
L9pTWWAATj7HoLaRe6ZA1Q,OGBl4pdcFne-gIpWAs8cKg,3,0,0,0,To be honest  I was a bit disappointed. Had the original philly  but it was so bland  I even needed to add a bit of salt to bring out the flavor of the red sauce. Note: the sauce is not at all spicy. Ill say  they ensure to keep the food warm even for pick up  so thats nice  the cheese was still hot when I had it at home. Also the people are really polite and nice. But not a place ill be trying anytime soon.
2c9VptksvowLgVUMnCgjw,EUfhzMlIvIbVH3QKqvRRUg,2,0,0,0,The only thing I found interesting about the place was the self tap tables which I didn't sit at. The service was horrible  my Bloody Mary was disgusting  and the place was a sausage fest ( too many guys). Also I was extremely disappointed by the small dance floor. I knew Dierks Bently was a sellout when they opened their bar in old town Scottsdale. This place is not true to country roots at all.
N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,R4ox2uOJsXHwRTODx0nKyg,5,0,1,0,We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open  so you can see the bar  kitchen  and casino floor.  I ordered the special that night  which was pappardelle pasta  a chunky tomato sauce  shredded lamb  kale  truffle-infused breadcrumbs  and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu  but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb  and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick  almost like tomato chunks  but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce  meat and kale was absolutely perfect.  I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive  so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally  I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth  and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich  buttery  and tasted phenomenal.   They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote  Happy Birthday  in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.  Yes  this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However  you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed. This is an incredibly unique  delicious restaurant.
H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25AyA,7aUDseTDT42CNb7O2POnvQ,2,0,0,0,Had a groupon decided to check it out  steak was good  server was lacking. It was busy and loud which wasn't bad but it was our first time there  so we weren't familiar withthe menu. Some of us had steak and some had salmon. The salmon came with sides and the steak did not. I wish the server would have told us more about the menu or asked if we wan't sides. The server checked in once and never offered anyone a refill of their drinks.  It felt like they were put out by the groupon and didn't want to deal with us. Prob won't return.
YF4QJjPM7cMZja6K1MwQ,xxY90bQt5Fcn_2UC3wmuIw,4,4,2,1,First I want to say that our group had an AMAZING time at Encore Beach!!!!!  BUT  we did end up dropping a ton of cash.  If you read the reviews carefully  you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad  or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables  but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)  There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star  and that is that they don't allow  oversized  bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags  but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags  but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission and a cabana for free.  We were like  hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach  the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too  but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.  OK  back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music  dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.  So suck it up and pay or else stay at your hotel pool (which was also awesome at Aria).
XwV2lISDp5Acy72bA8Qg,nOgT0qHs4qs1u4Kke_DJyA,4,1,1,0,We had a great stay at the Platinum.  I had no qualms at staying at a non-gaming (read: not a casino) hotel off the Strip.  It's a quick walk to all the action (about 5 to 10 minutes to the Flamingo depending on how quick you pound the pavement).    The suites are large  well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--I loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs.  The attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a King size bed.  As much as we liked the room  we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the Strip during much of the day and night.  Kinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal  but perhaps a little outdated.  I never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet  and I had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before I left the hotel).  The restaurant at the hotel served fairly yummy food at great prices (service was a little slow at times)  but what was EVEN BETER was the KILLER Happy Hour at the lounge.  Every day from 4 to 8 with half off all their appetizer menu  signature cocktails  wines by the glass  bottles that are sold by the glass  and then a selection of bottles that are served half off all day  all night.   We frequented the happy hour several times during our trip  and we were stoked every visit.    We plan on making this our home next time we stop in Vegas.  It's the perfect getaway off the Strip.
1hqOjPxgH8IXE4bNq6DFiw,DJNhNTwBVSsrsYVQi-iacg,4,0,1,0,Bruh  I'm a stickler for good wings.  Like to the point I can only eat them from about 4 places and I find those places to usually be inferior to the ones I make with my brother.  This place is a grade A dive and dump.  It is small  old  and needs remodeled   but the wings are still great!  They get crispy right.  And  the service was nice too.  The Buffalo  (seems like a standard combo of whirl and franks) someone is mixed in a way that exceeds other standard buffalo combos.   Also enjoyed the dry cajun.  The sirachi were a bit of a miss though.  Also  get the fries.  Get a small because they give you so many  but man they are good.  In short  take it from a wing expert...  the bad reviews are bunk or are based on that customer having bad service.
d8lmIZIqmBC9oPM8y1dc7Q,w_8Z6eAQINhQW3T0qF2cHA,4,0,0,0,The chips and salsa are so fresh and tasty that I could fill up on just those. They're addictive! We love the Paco's Taco with braised beef and charro beans. They have so many different tequilas & their drink menu is extensive and impressive. Margaritas are unbelievable. Highly recommended.
eTXYID00jGxq1vZpntBUFw,5S-UIhzBE3-dKagQUaQo-w,5,0,0,0,Where do I start!? Came here for the first time today and was a little shocked at the prices; we were already sitting down with our two little ones and they were hungry so we weren't going to try and look for another place to eat. We ordered the fried pickles to start with  and wow! I could not believe the size of these things! Shortly after we got our meals  and once again the portions were huge! I finally understood why things were priced the way they were. Everything was sooo good; we will definitely eat here again!
QiWwJiV27YFscyJAkAyrtw,tXIxT54p2XbLThD3WO3Nqg,2,3,10,5,I've been debating about writing this review.  I love cupcakes and I was so excited when I so this store.  The store inside the mall is very cute.  The staff is amicable  but not overly helpful.  Which is ok  the cupcakes look good  however  looks are not all  even for cupcakes.  I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut  as well as a Key Lime cake pop.  I tried the cake pop first.  It was gummy tasting and neon green.  I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime.  Then I took a bite out of the coconut one.  The cake per se was not bad  however the frosting tasted like oil.  Not appetizing.  So  I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town.  Again  the neon yellow color for the cake.  Where do they get these citrus. (see picture)  The cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store.  I ended up throwing them in my garbage  making sure to smoosh it down  in case I had a Miranda moment (only if you have watched Sex and the City you will get this).  At least I know I won't be tempted at the mall anymore.  I guess I should be thankful????
mLg4FenOcHpXZnW67QrVxw,JYwPq7v45Aa0g5Zz7Opmag,5,0,0,0,Very impressed. Jim from Dodge plumbing came out today and presented a very rational and logical argument for why his company should not take my money to convert over to an electric tank-less water heater due to out current logistics and electrical set up and why instead we should forgo this and stick with a gas system to save us money. Though they could have gone along with the estimate and soaked us for some money it was nice to get some honest feedback and Jim seems to have a great deal of varied construction experience to give just that.
OuIEuv7JLUHajkemxsVw,3S60rOhcvrXYq4ZyG3dV9g,4,1,1,0,3.5. Patio is great and spacious. Selection of beer and menu also great. I came here because of the more sophisticated menu variety. I ordered the steak tartare. It's okay  but if you've had steak tartare done right before skip it here. They use a chicken egg yolk. Tartare itself is not seasoned enough and left more to be desired. Salmon quinoa bloated. Duck fries were quite good and a large portion too. In terms of fruity beers  I didn't like my friend's cherry beer (reminded me of medicine taste(  but my peach beer was quite interesting and more bitter than I thought. The seating with half booth half stools are a bit weird  apparently my back doesn't like backless chairs. Either way  I would come back if I want beer in a less rowdy bar with an interesting menu for food.

Barking Dogs is the only place I buy my dog  Phoebe's food and get her groomed. Phoebs is even on a first name basis in this local gem. Staff is very knowledgeable about all things DOGS!!  They love your baby as much as you love them. Its literally less than a mile from my casa.  Yes  my pup and I are lucky and even spoiled with its location.  Be jealous.  Be very jealous. ;)

Can't beat their complementary bean dip and salsa! Food is always fresh and never disappointing. Fajitas are always a good choice and when you order the fresh guac  they'll prepare it at your table! It's like dinner and a show! Will definitely be back whenever I'm in town!
ipFobdM6X4SNMA9ZBfdAQ,#NAME?,4,1,1,1,I've eaten at this location twice. The first time I got a falafel to go. I thought the cilantro was a bit much for the falafel  it wasn't what I've been used to in the past. I like a milder basic falafel. Today I had a shawarma pita and it was really good. A little heavy on the red onions so next time I plan to ask for no onions! The price is great for the amount of good you get. My pita's are always loaded up.
ePt0qmZgUfjqMoM1M2U3Q,_oiPIf2txiXULFVRHu2rfA,5,0,1,0,This place is the best. My friends and I get takeout from here all the time  and it's great because I can exercise my total indecision right up to choosing food  because they have sooooooo many choices. Thai? Vietnamese? Chinese? Sushi? Tottie's has it all  and it is ALL delicious. Sugar Cane Chicken? Pho? Pad Thai? What are you in the mood for!? The prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are decent  not overwhelming  but everything is flavorful and distinctive.
w6F502EKMyn3ONbGT2bQxw,tketMNTsbOTlPyR6SNdDeg,2,0,0,0,way overrated  owner and manager have a seriously lousy attitude. Overpriced for sure. Bumpers is the place to go for the crab legs  not mushy like Pickle Bills. They have the river right outside the place so they feel they can justify the increased pricing.

C2T7ecxqsVu99PhSqT3c3g,UYm6DU_oaet9Tiq0ntDOVw,5,0,0,0,As a long-time fan of Chick-fil-A  I wasn't walking in expecting to be comparing the two. But as we ordered  sat down  and were served  I couldn't help it. The service is as good  if not better here than at CFA. The sauces are better  and so is the chicken! Everything was very clean and we were thoroughly impressed. I would like more sandwich options--I think next time I'll just be getting chicken strips because I ended up eating just the chicken off my pimento crunch sandwich. Very impressed!!!
5nyKUHibR4GCs6ojVljFdA,GAlLd8Yqm2bGeNiU2JbVNQ,1,0,0,0,Very disappointing  the price is too expensive for the food quality.   First of all  there is no green tea or red bean  ice cream on the menu.   They only have ice cream bar  and it is only one per person  on the menu  they didn't say that is limited. Secondly  way too much rice on the sushi. I guess thats how they make the money. Lastly  the ipad service is stupid. you have to wait for someone to confirm it. Overall  not a good reataurant for sushi.
ibf4xvHWD4t1DOOZhidHBg,d0Ph_WW7_bC3ivi6msOBNQ,1,1,7,1,There was hair in our food and drinks - multiple times!  We had to send out food and drinks back 3 different times.   We were about 10 deep in out party.  2 booths seated directly next to each other. One table ordered chicken tacos.  The minute the server sat the plate down we noticed there was hair in it.  She took it right back.   One of our Margaritas came out immediately after .. there was a long strain of hair floating on top.  The server took it right away and apologized - again.  The other table ordered nachos .. and guess what ... hair was it ... stuck in the Queso.  This time the server stood there and waited until we looked over the nachos.  We both noticed the hair.  He said WOW!  You guys see it's not my hair (he had a short brown cut with a cap on).   He again  returned the nachos and we decided not to order anything else.    I'll never return!
SX7vTahSnoVeJQ6N86PMw,uLBDbsUInnGcjepbXQyU-Q,1,0,0,0,They worry about their therapist but not their customers. I've been going on here for awhile and one time I missed and forgot about my appointment they charged me $60. They said that's the least they charge. Normally it's full price of your service. If it was so important not to miss an appointment why don't they give an automated text reminder within 1-2 hours of appointment like other places???
O6BlCviQBIEcGW4ll6ZsQ,AhVJhCrAcfQUiWmcZue4bQ,5,1,3,1,So idk why ppl are giving this place such a hard time. I'm reviewing for EDC weekend. We checked in Thursday (the 20th). The guy up front gave me great service.  If you're looking for a place just to crash it's not bad. Nice location. Mid strip. Kinda hidden though. It was a bit hard to get ppl to find us haha. Don't expect a hot tub or something fancy. Like I said  just a place to crash.
vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,tEKoICi-_lOLO81nNhChAw,1,0,1,0,The most important thing for a restaurant is food safety and clean. See what I got from my dish. Other bugs maybe still forgivable. But cockroach means this restaurant is really dirty nasty and not take their kitchen clean job seriously.
BJ3AyMhTaORAueJ2KNEQ,eO0CuXENTBYcizwHxGcVqg,2,0,1,0,My wife and I participated in the MS Walk and decided it was the perfect opportunity to give the famous River Cafe a try.  What a beautiful spot and a great ambience.  We were greeted by a couple friendly hostesses and shown to an indoor table as the patio was full.  We got a great spot by the window that opened  so a great compromise. The experience.  The menu did not have a lot of lunch options (brunch was the focus of the day) and the ones that were offered were somewhat difficult to figure out.  Frustrated I ordered the bison burger and my wife had the flatbread.  The food came quickly enough (wasn't busy) but that is where it all went awry.  The bison burger was small yet I could not finish it as there was a strange flavour to it that made it sickening after a while.  The potato salad that accompanied it was good. The flat bread was not good.  There must have been something wrong with it as it had a sweet but pungent smell (and taste) to it.  We are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check  and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird. The server did concur that something seemed off and promptly took the item off the bill which was appreciated  but also expected as it was not edible. Overall I am glad we went because we had been wondering about this place but I would be very hesitant to go back.

M0yfSpeDaYTPEnLjw0gg,vsd6DoMG32MB6W-3Ht3b8A,1,0,2,1,My husband and I ordered our wedding cake here. We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert's movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it  she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12  x 12  square and 10-12  tall  like I said pyramid. We got an 8  square base  next layer 6  base and the top layer 4  base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4  tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2  diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out  the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake  never called us or the manager lady with questions  just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night  everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery  furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything. After all we didn't want the money  we wanted the cake. So anyway  I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery  I  would rather make a homemade cake. I also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on.
SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,G6plYqsB4w51-QJLx67tuQ,4,0,0,0,In town for a convention and looking for something away from the strip. Found this place on Yelp and was not disappointed. Mango margaritas were tasty as were the shrimp tacos. The waiter mistakenly brought me the fish tacos (which were actually quite good as well) and was very apologetic when I pointed this out. He then replaced them as quickly as possible.

The gentleman working this morning was patient in explaining their offerings .  The coffee was smooth and only needed a bit of almond milk - kudos to the cafe for having that as an available option.    I had the pleasure of enjoying the croissant  it had the right amount of flakiness and was bigger than expected.  The atmosphere was casual and laid back.  I now look forward to trying this place out later in the day.

The only reason for the 4 is because the room service food was not too great and there were some items left from the previous guests in the room  which tells me that room service does not do a thorough job.

I would have given them 5 stars but the last time I was there  the food arrived cold and we asked them to reheat it. It came back to the table just as cold the second time.  The patio is a great people-watching spot in the summer plus it's bring your own wine which helps keep the cost down seeing as it is a tad overpriced.
jb7pFtM4J5Hu9tCaoGxnRQ,n4gTlCKpXBah7Ao_pv7Xpw,5,0,2,0,I love this place.  I admit I am stuck on the Old Fashioned Turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce.  This is real fresh roast turkey (I think roasted daily but not sure) on great wheat bread  the sauce has just a bit of a bite and compliments the sandwich well.  Huge helping of turkey.    The setting is in an old pecan grove with mature trees  and grass.  A very relaxed kind of place to just enjoy the Phoenix weather the food and those you are with.  It closes during the Summer and I can't wait for it to open back up in the Fall.  The perfect ending however  are the deserts.  They are all hommade  and terrific.  I can't get past the pecan pie  perhaps the best in Phoenix.  The crust is just right flaky  and it's loaded with pecans.  I'm hungry again just writing this review
lywduRzRWrZLD03L2ZINhQ,wNKVnmK-8_MxzwykEZPT2g,1,0,2,0,I don't normally like to do this  but I have to after the terrible experience I just had. Centurylink has the WorST customer service I've ever experienced. Two weeks ago I put in my order and the tech was scheduled to come in yesterday. Nobody showed up and nobody called to reschedule. Today I called  was on the phone for almost two hours  transferred to four people and was told they had to reschedule for Thursday  there was nothing they could do to help me earlier. I even talked to a supervisor who was the worst  supervisor  I've ever dealt with. Two hours later and I now have to wait until Thursday. Nobody apologized  nobody seemed to care. I told them if they don't come Thursday I'll be cancelling my service and going with Cox. Also  this whole time I was on their site talking with a live customer service rep online trying to figure this out  but all they told me was they couldn't do anything. So today's Worst Company Award goes to Centurylink.
1f7AEcZfKF7F4hvehrUqaw,ypkzI6POzwhj4RVxIo1Wxg,2,0,1,0,Food was OK. Nothing special. Its tastes like frozen food. I had the chicken breast over veggies  and my son had a southwest wrap. I think the best part was the sauces they use. The smoothie is just some concentrated mix  no real fruit. Not my cup o tea. This is a family ran joint. Which is fine  but how I found out it was family owned and operated was not fine. Scene- Husband and wife arguing about daily duties and how they cant keep doing  this  every day. Along with the wife grilling (no pun intended) her daughter about letting the dog out  homework and so on. I wasn't eves dropping  they were standing 10 feet away from my table. It was hard not to hear. Leave that stuff at home. Nobody wants to hear it.

The bad...the awful shrimp dish...spiced just right but the shrimp was overcooked...how much...obviously reheated  or held too long...like biting into a whole water chestnut. I should have sent the dish back. Did mention it too the waiter...oh  I will tell the chef...no response at all from management...were busy bs..ing at the bar.  Lesson learned by me...just return the 'bloody' dish...just hate doing that though...would I go back...yes  definitely
S5bNE4Pmin8OQUMOFod8bQ,A2qR0dD7vNTMiAiWzquTCA,5,5,3,2,I admit that I haven't tried ALL the italian restaurants in Toronto... but of the ones that I have tried  Ciao has been the place that I've gone to multiple times.   Why? Let me count the ways: 1. Reserved table is always ready  2. Amazing service 3. Fabulous Wine Selection 4. The patio feels so European in the Summer 5. The portions are huge! 6. The quality and taste of the food is amaze 7. It's in Yorkville - the perfect locale for a quaint after dinner walk 8. The olives with the bread - delish!  I feel like there's probably a lot more reasons - but I also feel like this is enough to make you want to check it out for yourself!  ps. Be sure to order the Mushroom Risotto - it's divine!!
MVSmAYSl4RkgXBg5e8JaQ,JZIyd29beH1K49HyT67fjw,1,0,2,0,OPH all over this country is amazing. I've enjoyed them in Minneapolis  Chicago  LA and Seattle.  I cannot believe how bad this location is and I hate that this is the only location in the valley of the sun.  Please... someone... open another franchise somewhere else in this valley.. PLEASE!
XXWOFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,QDs-Y_KqB_Pgct6he8XKmg,5,0,0,0,Hands down the best place to eat in Vegas! The food is priced well and the food is delicious! I would have eaten here everyday if I'd known this place was here! My wife absolutely loves this place as well. Service was awesome which is s bonus!
hDD6yk1yuuRIvfdtHsISg,RO1CkfAEJA_PBrse6bHfsg,2,1,1,1,It's good. The rolls are better than the sashimi although one time we had some really nice(and surprising) maguro. We always get the hamachi jalapeño roll and some sashimi so don't get me wrong when I say the rolls are better than the sashimi. It's still enjoyable. Good atmosphere and my girl likes the martinis. Little Tokyo in Mt. Lebanon and Kiku in Station Square are better. Nakama is good for some enjoyable sushi and  more importantly  the atmosphere.  You can go here and watch the pens game and eat a roll.  Can't say that about a lot of sushi restaurants.  4.5 of 10 relative to sushi quality alone
QHZw2L6LV1qmExNJbfhIsQ,zWC_im2EhtjV-ifJs2yxOw,1,0,3,2,Reservation = walk in.  Pointless to make reservations.  We made a reservation the day before for 11:00am the next day morning. When we arrived we are not being served but was asked to wait.  This is  pointless for reservation  as at the same time they still take walk in and people who has reservation is under the same queue with the walk in.  After 30min  we asked how much longer will be the wait? The lady answered  no idea  I don't know . Avoid this restaurant.
8mIrXLrOnAqWsB5JrOojQ,607yTunGJNzx4v9iKhmTVw,3,2,5,3,The first & most important thing you need to know is this place is not FAMILY FRIENDLY  leave the kids at home because they are certainly not welcomed...they're allowed inside but make sure they leave any kind of expression of joy at the door before entering.   Second thing to know  INDOor VOICES ONLY. Whispered excitement guarantees you won't be asked to leave. Yes  it's a pinball arcade  but it's a  MUSEUM  pinball hall of fame.   Third & last thing (I think) to know is not to expect favorable employee characteristics. At least not from the guy with the gray ponytail...especially not from him actually  maybe just avoid all contact with him if possible.   Once you understand those 3 essential things you are sure to enjoy your time. With rows of pinball machines there is plenty to check out  the variety is not lacking. You can certainly stretch $10-20 into a good couple hours worth of play.   Duck Hunt is the biggest tease....NEVER in working order when I'm there.
eTXYID00jGxq1vZpntBUFw,L0-DOsxPOqjlFKr6vg-PKA,5,0,0,0,Ok  this place had us right from the start. My wife just finished  running a marathon and was extremely cold. Seeing her shiver  our waiter brought her a cup of homemade chicken vegetable soup on the house. Who does that these days?  The service really was great. From start to finish. The food was excellent. It was standard fare for a grill but you can tell those that prepared it really cared.   I had the LA wrap and my wife had more soup. Both were really good. They make fresh  homemade soup every day.   I'll be back. You should give them a try too.
ffLK5rktOFlH26vZU5xqQ,ZZXyJhzMoY1SFvyp5bRGgw,1,0,0,2,Frybread is good  but there isn't enough substance. I got some watered down beans  hardly any ground beef and mostly lettuce.
XXWOFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,BleJTqbz6iRJudMrFOxQsg,2,2,2,2,I'm very surprised that after 20+ reviews this place has a 4 1/2 average rating.  First off  so you don't think I'm some elitist bastard  let me state that I happily eat food at IHOP and Denny's.   Anyway  so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas  apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...     Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad  and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).      So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w/curly fries.  First off  the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food  even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.   Anyway  the service and price were okay  decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip  or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas. ~G
j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA,0ZHXbGl9o3fuynuTDV1BJA,4,0,0,0,Located at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Great service  fast or slow depending on how busy it is. I ordered beef/broccoli  chicken chow mein soft noodles  & a small wonton soup. I didn't like the green bell pepper in the chow mein (next time I will order without it). Today  I ordered a noodle soup with chicken and vegetables. Definitely  hit the spot. I added some soy sauce and chili for flavor. One of my favorite chinese restaurants'.
kBjTP2DFmHYEEG4MpE4Iyw,0c4TWXe1hj6853wSsrMaag,5,0,1,0,WOW - this place is incredible.  It is huge  well lit  organized and everything is used and reasonably priced.  Saw this place on Yelp and had to check it out.  They advertise as an entertainment exchange store.  They take trades on books  magazines  movies  CDs  games......   I have never seen a used place this well  great.  Wish we had something comparable in Denver.
qQCsLGMncJp1xWUGnOKCQA,R2EWiOvw0O5yBDrBNnJ4jA,5,0,1,0,I love this place... it's great to have a neighborhood center with good food and great coffee!!  The patio is great all year long.
9wM6SK5QsyHE1P89kyUzQ,HnlvyBInDiXXdDnpiv2YQQ,3,0,2,0,I highly recommend this spa. Asian foot massage spas are a dime a dozen out here but this one was professional  clean and overall very pleasant. This is the place to get your massages! Out-of-towners; take an evening off the main strip and take a cab out to this Chinatown strip. Get a foot massage here  dinner and tea downstairs and visit the shops on this part of town.
Mv7N0bU56dhtoDPm2JOow,OJ4jA-fIzola_DIRhKFlTw,1,0,0,0,I was treated to lunch here and even for a free lunch it was not satisfying.  First my french onion soup had very little flavor  almost watered down.  The cheese was overcooked and clumping and the bread was just... bread in my soup.  I had the short ribs for my entree.  The ribs where extremely dry and overcooked.  The portions are small and the meat was so inedible that I didn't even finish my meal.  What flavor that was infused was just sauce cooked onto the meat and no flavor from the meat itself.  I was extremely disappointed.  My guess is that they garner the majority of their business from out of towners staying in the hotel it is connected to.  This will definitely not be in my lunch rotation downtown.
9KmvrnyjWTr4sly0Dt770g,yBOJJFaaBLogGmzMBmzkHg,5,0,0,0,A little pricey but worth it! Crepes were delicious! We got the seafood and chicken pesto. Really cute back area and service was good. Would come back!
dhbJ85DAPBDrUjPK6uh44A,LdzyocCD5CnmR6g2Qtr8Kg,4,3,3,1,If there are two things I like  they are eating and drinking. And gastropubs really let me do both at the same time very well. So they're already on a good footing with me.  Gaspar is a very nice place inside. It has a cozy  warm feeling  with its dim (but not too dim) interior  exposed brick and wood. Tip: you can get in either on Rue de la Commune or Rue Saint Paul  or through the hotel to which it is attached.  Both times I came I sat at the bar  and received excellent and friendly service. The first time it was Monday evening  and it was dead (and late November...and cold outside). I had the (BBQ Bourbon Bacon) Burger (that's a lot of Bs). While it was cooked more than I'd have liked (I wasn't asked how I wanted it done  and didn't think to specify...stupid me!) it still tasted very good. Cooked a bit less it could be a top 20 burger for me. I also subbed fries out for cheesy mashed taters (no extra charge) and they were yummy too. Oh  and I had a pint of beer  which was beery good.  Second visit  Thursday night and the place was much more hopping. There was live music  drink specials and a generally good vibe in the place. I had steak frites  which was cooked to the medium I specified (I was asked this time) and good  though not exceptional. The fries (aka frites) were very good. The highlight of the meal  believe it or not  was the pea soup which was so good I almost licked the bowl when I finished! You can bet I'll be ordering that again next time I'm there. Oh  and I had a house beer or two ($6/pint).  You can bet I'll be back (probably very soon)!
LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw,J0QPv4pthmGvf5n55f--oA,4,0,0,0,Great burger. One of the best fast food burgers I've ever had  right behind 5 guys.
BgthHqiXot2s4SdxcI6DQ,FwcE6m63rGU9WuEMQcG6sg,4,5,7,6,I've been a fan of Pita Jungle since my ASU days  when I lived down the street from the Apache location. Now I live in the Arcadia area so this is the one we frequent. I haven't noticed a huge difference between the two locations  same great food  same stoned servers.  My usual is the Portabello burger. The balsamic marinade they use is fantastic. The presentation is a little messy  but once it hits your lips it's so good.  I pass on the new potatoes for steamed spinach and it's pretty amazing.  Everyone knows the hummus rocks. I love how they let you split up a small order between the roasted bell pepper and jalapeno cilantro. It's like a little hummus sampler for less than $5.  The service can be spotty  especially when it comes to drink refills  but I've surprisingly never had an order come out incorrectly. I normally would not be surprised by this standard service expectation being consistently fulfilled  but I have had some BAKED servers here  so the fact that they can remember my steamed spinach substitution each and every time is kind of impressive. So  good job  stoned servers. Maybe work on the drink thing  though.
FvVSy2r7zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,BbqSinZv9Bkj_dqV-wG_nQ,4,0,0,0,There is nothing bad in here !! It's true. Amazing bagels  bakery section  I've always loved their sandwiches and there omelets are so good. I remember they used to be in the sun coast hotel and they had some amazing sugar free desserts. I don't know if they make them anymore. Sad . But do go  it's so good .
yGMCl0vYigshkXiZFIDTNw,SY2y82raSVfjkeEz-vJeGg,4,0,0,0,We arrived for our reservation at 7:15pm.  They seated us right on time.  The resturant was fairly loud at first but once the family dinner croed cleared out at 7:30pm it quieted down.  The food and service was outstanding  and at a very reasonable price.  I highly recommend Mimi's very a late dinner.
Ul6JwluSTm12PVDIqnNaTg,qMWqILHOKKJlfkUM21Ja_g,1,0,0,0,Very overpriced for what you get. I had the skirt steak which was stringy and tough. I've had much better meals at mad mex. Our server was extremely impersonal and we were rushed out. Will not return.
g8oxQ1Ji9mr9PMjhEfaWSg,XQw1ftsidr-pkqLdmTzrbw,1,0,0,0,If you are looking for entertainment from the wait staff  save your time and money because you will not get it at this location.  Not only did we not have an interactive waitress  we did not see any around us.  We love Dick's Last Resort  however  going to this location was a total let down for our family.  This experience for us was nothing more than a very expensive dinner with no entertainment.  Very disappointing...
dMbvkmRli5sbvSikuDMw,uj_VC-5WsRa9fhD0j6PYyw,2,1,4,4,I can see why The Packhouse is not a packed house. (See what I did there?)  I already wasn't really thrilled about coming to this joint. I checked the reviews  they weren't really poppin. I looked at pics  weren't enough of them. And the menu looked... okay.  But I'm always down for something new and different and my homie was eager to check this place out  so why not?  Welp  it wasn't good my friend.   I ordered the Packhouse burger; because  if you can't do a burger right  then something is seriously wrong. And it was ALL wrong. Not once but twice.  My other homie decides to get the same thing. She didn't want the tomato jam (she's allergic to tomatoes) and she wanted hers cooked medium well. I wanted the tomato jam and my meat to be cooked medium. You following so far?   We both asked for the Mac and cheese as a side. Side note: why do they not have fries???!!! Not even sweet potato fries???!! Like forreal tho. Anyway  they bring out my homies burger and my other friends dish. They bring out my food last. There's a TON of mustard on my burger. Literally all I can taste is mustard. They killed my meat. Like if the cow wasn't dead before they cooked it  they made sure they killed it when they grilled it. And after a few bites I noticed I didn't have any tomato jam. Come to find out they switched me and my homies Burgers. Although her meat was well done and dry as well. My homie is breaking out (tomato allergy) and I'm just over the burger.   They were nice enough to comp our burgers and asked if we wanted new ones. We were good with that. They also said they would give us free dessert. OKAAAAY!!!  New Burgers come out  they get the toppings right and the chef wasn't as enthusiastic with the mustard the second go round. HOWEVER! My meat was still dry and over cooked. {sigh}.... whatever. I couldn't finish the burger. Like the meat was a choking hazard.   The Mac and cheese was aight. I love Gouda  but it wasn't hittin it. Ah well.  My other homie said her crab cake was too juicy. I didn't get much else from her meal but she did say this place was 2 star worthy as well.   Also we get the complimentary bread and butter AFTER we get our food. The homie has to ask for the bread and butter. Strange and not needed at that point.   The desserts (forgot to take pics) were actually really good. The hummingbird cake was moist and not too sweet. I don't like nuts but I had several bites anyway cause the flavor was really good.   The oatmeal cream pie cookie joint was pretty good but again I'm not a fan of nuts and thick creamy icing. But anyone who is down for this  would love it!   So there you have it.   The service was top notch. I gave more than 20% of what my bill would have been because I can't fault the staff  but I'm sorry guys  the food needs some work.   The location and setup is dope. The vibe is chill and everyone is really attentive and nice. If they work on the food  I can see this place getting packed with the quickness.
KUlm5OuKYJ6nGj0EUwcY9w,qZRwShWBjxG2PcK73cuxzQ,4,0,2,0,I like to come here every 3-6 months. I'm not huge on injera  so every quarter to half a year is enough to get my fix.  I have loved this place every single time I went  except the last.   The (beautiful) waitress is really helpful in helping you choose a dish and (again other than my last visit) they are always delicious. Unfortunately the last time I went the dish she recommended tasted like old Chinese food (which is very strange) but I've been probably 10 other times and each time it has been delicious  so I'm going to just assume it was a one-off bad day and give it another try  because honestly the food is generally really good and filling.   Prices are decent  they have Groupons available for this place a lot  so if you are nervous about going  wait for a Groupon to be available and that should cover half the meal for 2-3 people.   The place is usually pretty packed but on a week night you can usually get a seat without having to wait.
pBXtjN43eqMV0XZTz7nmw,KioEhP3q5YwYRlRUNR7I6A,5,0,0,0,Listen don't complain that you got in late or the guy at the door was rude if you get there if you get there past 11pm who do you think you are the Kardashians?! I mean seriously I get bottle service every single time and I do not get there later than 10-1030 pm sure the club may still be empty but i would muchhh rather hang out at my sickkk table than wait in a line for 2 hours. AMAZING CLUB if you have game you willl have fun I highly recommend a table it is keyyy because you get tired of dancing for a few hours you go back to your table with some chicks hang out for a quick 20 then your back at it going nuts!
Os1n1idfw9vv9kwULGJnQ,eD6_jtZ4mEVk9HU0gO0BLg,4,0,0,0,this hawaiian/korean restaurant brought me back to the local cuisine of  hawaii. I ordered the meat jun combo plate and it was good. the soy dipping sauce for the meat jun should be bottled and sold in markets. deifinitely stopping by to try the other items on the menu. The ALOHA spirit is deifinitely alive and well in las vegas..thanks to RUSSEL.
UaoOIiwPFrp2BWYDHkPQ,HkEmN3ezE_A9Em10OMDc8w,3,0,1,0,I just got the apple fritter. I wanted to love it so much... the texture was nice the apple chunks were perfect. However..... it was so greasy I lost all the good flavor to grease. I am honestly disappointed  and not satisfied at all. They were very nice  and even warmed my one lowly apple fritter up. I just wish it were less greasy.

XwV2lISDp5Acy72bA8Qg,aRidF5IYq5VoK5oMgFu43Q,5,3,8,4,When looking up hotels to stay in  I was skeptical about this and many other hotels  as one usually is in a city the've never visited. However  I was extremely pleased with my stay at Platinum.  Location: Located next to an AM/PM gas station. This was great because I could pregame on the cheap before we went to various places. The hotel is very visible but still in the cut. About a half mile or so from the Venetian.  Customer Service: When I walked in  I was greeted with warmth. It was about 1 am  so not many people were in the lobby. Which was actually the case throughout my entire trip. I chatted with the front desk associate like we were old friends. He was just that nice. And he made me feel so welcome!  Room: Can I tell you that this room was EVERYTHING in LIFE?! Ok. There I told you. I was in room 402 I believe. This room was in fact a suite. I felt like it was an apartment and I had a lease. Freaking HUGE! It had separate areas for a kitchen (complete with full fridge  stove / oven  microwave  dishwasher and bar)  living room  balcony  bedroom with 2 queen beds  a safe  closet and tv and bathroom with closet  garden tub  separate bathroom and double sink vanity. The bathroom was the size of most rooms. Completely clean!!!!  I stayed in it by myself. What a wondrous time!!!!!!! I had everything I needed and then some. And the view! Perfect view of the strip. It's the perfect way to be a part of Vegas without all the noise and smoke you get in a hotel with a casino. At half the price. Or less  depending on when you go. My first night in Vegas was spent relaxing in my beautiful room.  Tip: Even if you can't go get a full massage or service at the spa  at least purchase a cupcake bath salt from them and use in that beautiful tub. So relaxing!  I will def be bringing my sister and cousin back this March! Can't wait!  Im sure I left something out but you get the gist right? If not....stay here!! You won't regret it!

eTXYID00jGxq1vZpntBUFw,IasB0l7sv78JQaSZWp4b3g,5,0,0,0,Stopped here for lunch after our dam tour based on yelp reviews. We were starving and this place hit the spot. Do yourself a favor and get the cheese sticks!  YUM!  Girlfriends had the bacon burger and said it was top notch. I had the BBQ chicken salad and it was also very good. Service was good too. All in all 6 thumbs up from the 3 of us!
oj8qk3W7O9oq15VIsvYJQ,D64a7grXSsW2P7hJi_oRXQ,5,0,0,0,Great place.  We stayed at the Hermosa Inn  and dinner and breakfast at Lon's were included as part of our package.  We were warmly greeted by the gentleman who was the host upon entering.  Dinner was fantastic - the strip steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Started with the tortilla soup and finished with the panna cotta.  But our favorite part of the meal was the side of truffle fries - wow!  Thought it was great that they had local beer options from McFate Brewing on tap - rare to find them on tap around the valley outside of the brewery.  Our server was very pleasant and helpful  and my wife got a birthday card from the staff since it was her birthday.   We returned for breakfast the next day.  Breakfast menu was considerably smaller and a lot less options  but the food was really good.  I had the ham & cheese omelette  which was great.  Large portion of toast accompanied my omelette  and the crispy potatoes that came with the omelette were really good.    Overall a really great experience - wouldn't hesitate to return for an upscale meal.
QS3QxI7u5PRdtbGgI0UsA,1oQ8JMXrYVbzWeOV3To0Vw,4,1,0,0,I've been to Sakana twice for lunch and both times have been happy with the sushi and service. Instead of creating longer rolls with more pieces of sushi they create shorter  fatter rolls. Makes for a bigger piece of sushi which I'm ok with.   I'd say the quality of fish  rice and seaweed is good to very good. I had 3 rolls and walked away full and content. It's not the very best sushi I've ever had but it's a great choice here in Scottsdale.   If you're in the area and are looking for a good sushi restaurant I'd recommend you try Sakana out.
YF4QJjPM7cMZja6K1MwQ,9xmB7hpqcPS6LvXjrnWHaQ,2,0,3,4,There is absolutely no point in coming here if you come late or do not have a daybed.  You won't have anywhere to put your stuff which is a nuisance.  There is bag check but the lines are long.  Plus  sometimes you don't want to stand the entire time in the pool after standing in the long lines in the sun.  I saw a girl get hooked up to an IV and taken out on a wheelchair.  Stay classy  Vegas.  Also.... the water gets murky after a while.  Do you really want to go in there?  You would be putting yourself at risk for foot fungus or STDs.  If you do decide to go here  you can go in with full-fledged self-confidence because people will flaunt their stretch marks  cellulite  and other goodies.
jG1jcAeDw0pZTHCNC5kww,o2KT5D8ZMi-nIXHB3s6zsw,2,0,2,0,This place is gross. It was understaffed. I was given a super dry  day old chicken in my Ceasar salad. The water made me sick. I am hoping a truly do not have food poisoning but definitely feel sick to my stomach after eating here.  I will not eat here again.

HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,_n1KOx4chiwrM5y_0m0IcQ,3,2,5,2,This is my second visit; my first was back during CES in Jan. with a young friend visiting Vegas for the first time and who had never had a bloody mary...  Service was very good  the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive  and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.  I liked it enough to want to go again.  Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim  pickles  cheese cubes  peppers   candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics  only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.  Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant  but everything else about the service was off  from how scarce our server was  to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us   yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders  to how long it took to get our order.  I got the wings - terrible  even though they are a signature dish. Bland  small  bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it  I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back.   Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.  I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well  the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)  Two stars or even one if not for the Bloody Mary meal or Jack Daniels chocolate cake.
ZRHSidI7IIeXhTHMc9Lgw,DnFbSPXl5kdtjlQGc9l-wQ,5,0,0,0,We love Kneader's! Their French toast is literally the best French toast ever. And their breakfast sandwich on a croissant is sooooo yummy. We always have the best service there. Workers are nice and friendly and we get our food quickly. Highly recommend Kneaders! A great place to go to brunch with friends.
tMYYSWyTppDcF070HmykQ,LBh-oRd5enTZBoNiKhHpmA,4,15,17,9,BRFC is a solid place to try some really good chicken. I've been very happy on my recent visits to BRFC. Our chicken combos were tender  juicy  crispy  and flavorful. We like to order their chicken tender combos and dip them in all their different sauces. My husband and I really enjoy it and plan on returning.   Pros:   * Friendly & efficient service when you order at the counter  * Clean and modern decor with plenty of seating/table options and large windows * Large TVs (we watched football during one of our visits)  * Combos include their shoestring fries and small cup of coleslaw    Fries: skinny  crispy  salty  and plentiful | Coleslaw: a bit bland for my taste * Their juicy chicken has a nice crisp crunch with a tasty and flavorful seasoning.    Their chicken is delicious with a slight spicy dry coating (a hint of cajun)    We do not find it to be greasy and the breading was light and not overwhelming  * Their Boylan pop is served at a soda fountain and is sweetened with cane sugar and refillable * Their iced tea is sweetened with honey or unsweetened and refillable * Milkshakes are thick and creamy and my husband always orders one with his chicken * Honey Dipping Sauce options: wildflower  chipotle and wasabi honey flavors    I LOVE all their honey options for my chicken tenders  * Other Dipping Sauce options: habanero hot sauce and their own BRBBQ barbecue dip * Lunch Box Special Deal:  M-F |  11am - 4pm  | 3 whole wings  fries  and a drink = 8 bucks   Cons:   * It seems a bit pricey for what it is. Essentially  it is priced a little higher than what you would expect for a chicken joint. You're looking at $10 - $15 a person for combos. However  I do find it to be a higher quality than most chicken joints. It's an upscale atmosphere for a 'fast casual' restaurant.    Review 1 for 2017
dMbvkmRli5sbvSikuDMw,ozHXb0TmdC1t8ki0N-zj8A,5,0,0,0,We have been wanting to try this place since it opened and finally went Saturday evening.  We sat on the patio and had some delicious cocktails.  We eventually went in and sat at a table for dinner.  The chicken and waffle appetizer was delicious.  For entrees we ordered the shrimp and grits and the steak.  Everything was delicious except for that the cook could not get my steak right.  They tried three times to achieve medium rare but just couldn't get it right.  Fortunately  for me our waitress who was fabulous was more upset about it than I was.  She would take it back to the kitchen even before I had the opportunity to complain.  The manager stopped by and was so apologetic and gave us a gift card to come back.  Even though I would probably never order the steak again  we will definitely be back for the ambience  the drinks  the other yummy food  but most of all for the EXCELLENT customer service that is so rare to find these days.  Well done Trey!  Thank you!
oFHvr1cAktvUbQgrl4aPw,nCSQ3WMm0Xi5WYABItfUYA,5,0,0,0,The amazing food and friendly atmosphere keeps us coming back!! My hubby is vegetarian and we love how we can choose anything off the menu for the both of us and it tastes delicious!
Wxxvi3LZbHNIDwJZimtnA,Z9JPvNlJmayTs6csfIqYag,4,0,0,0,The Venetian is an elegant and distinguished resort and casino. Gorgeous and romantic decor and interior. On the way to your room  you are greeted by candlelit hallways and ceilings to light your way. Even though I didn't try the restaurant  Bouchon  the smells emanating from the kitchen made my mouth water. The casino was expansive and had signs everywhere for easy navigation. Rooms are huge  clean  and well-maintained. The convenience store and bakery/coffeeshop is located at the entrance to the casino and near the elevators to the rooms which is a plus if you need to get a quick pick-me-up or forgot to pack something. The Venetian is a must-stay if you are ever in Las Vegas and will give you a dining  gambling  and staying experience that you will never forget.
XXWOFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,FZUZGiKn_nqzd5HgR3l6Zg,4,1,0,1,This place was worth the taxi ride! The food was great and affordable! The atmosphere was fun and it is nice that it is a little bit off the strip and away from the chaos. The portions were huge and my friend and I ordered several items to split between us. There are great breakfast options and there is a very casual vibe
I4NrMVc26qWr08S3Q1ow,lvEYRVCVtzkWs8HhO9NhCw,5,0,0,0,My wife ate here and I had pizza from another place she had the Vinnys sandwich and it was huge and it was so huge and so much she ate half and couldn't eat no more gave the other half to a older lady later that day we saw her walking down the strip and she said the sandwich was excellent to my wife really liked it it was just too much for one person to eat
uKKNw68mZZaa1jcyszEbyA,piM9rfdwv5isjVu5FS32WA,5,0,0,0,Wow  so delicious.  I don't have any pictures to post because we ate everything too fast!  We used the check-for free coffee and tea to start while we munched on the complementary granola  which was a nice roasted salty and sweet flavor.  Then our savory crepes came out quickly  the breakfast burrito for him and a custom buckwheat for me (white cheddar since they were out of Gouda  with local ham).  Mine came with a side of dressed greens that complemented the crepe well.  I was disappointed I could only order scrambled eggs on the side when I wanted a gooey poached egg because they had already cracked all the eggs  so I skipped the eggs.  As we finished up our main course our sweet crepe came out.  I was surprised how full I was from the one savory crepe  but I made room for my half of a simple bruleed crepe with nuts.  You can really taste the quality of the crepe itself when it's minimally dressed.  We finished with the complementary dessert of chocolate triangles and a rose infused marshmallow roasted right at the table.  Overall I'm very happy with our experience and the friendly service.  We struck up some good conversation with the server and found everyone but the cashier to be friendly.  I will definitely be back soon!
pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA,QzH5dmXI5VY5i-mXCZ6Rzw,4,1,2,1,I came here on a saturday night for dinner to celebrate my 25th birthday with the best of company  fun entertainment  and delicious food!!! I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that  on to the main event.   We had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested  omakase style :)  - Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :)  - A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame  roasted shito peppers  and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick) - Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating  we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.   - Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much.  - Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked  very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however  was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside!  - Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean  everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :)  - MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce  the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom  milky  full flavored  salty  a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!!  - 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent  nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.    ***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol   OVERALL RATINGS: Food - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that) Food (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars!  Drink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio Presentation - 4 stars Service & Ambiance - 4 stars  I gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night  and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood  just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats  good drinks  and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I'd DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!
giCq1MmWS2tvNOAHvJcQ,#NAME?,4,0,0,0,we enjoyed excellent service and very good food. salads were perfect as was soft shell crab and chicken livers. broad pasta was excellent as was scottish beef. very good and extensive wine list. wonderful experience and good value for the price
iRvhTcQbPNaEk3HxEQ8A,CV9yIWmDrHYhbm4JgFrmvQ,5,2,0,0,Today my friend and I came in for a body massage.  Let me tell you! The staff was very consistent  they ask you if you're okay while giving you massage in troubled areas. Very relaxing and clean. I didn't get my misuses name but she did a fantastic job.  And I came home feeling so relaxed with no more tight pressure in my back. I am so happy my friend and I chose this place.
OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,AMd8GL76wIZnqp3P-cju5A,5,0,1,0,I LOVED this buffet. To me it was comparable to The Buffet at The Wynn. They had prime rib  warm snow crab legs  ceviche  sushi  an omelet bar  and a little of everything. Tons of desserts as well!! Define lay coming back next trip to Vegas..
PiGd6nJRhbU3s7nP7XOE0g,AAEcnKkbEksIZMMD8Btxgw,3,0,0,0,So the food is pretty good but overpriced. The thing that irks me is there was basically no alcohol in the Caesars I ordered. I am small  I had two  and I wasn't even tipsy. No taste of alcohol  no feel of it. Super lame. Also  no happy hour.
cs1qJvnWUgf8g020z3PQ,PTtsb_WaOKpZ7npLrJva0w,5,0,0,0,What can you say about this place that hasn't already been said. The hype is true  and we're lucky to have nationally renown chef Chris Bianco stay here in Phoenix all these years. Pizzas are perfect  and pastas are surprisingly great & fresh (if you can resist ordering a pizza). Menu is often changing and new additions and recommendations are usually worth taking. Have not yet been to the original downtown location  am intimidated by no reservations and what I expect to be long lines for a reputable place. The  Town & Country  location is fashionable shabby chic  not intimidating. Parking is kind of a cluster. Look forward to coming here again on the next possible date night.
dyq9my28t5NW8N6s8OgfA,EZc4yrQzIQD2xEX9w254qQ,2,0,1,0,Yet another example of a business cashing in on location at the expense of quality. Cocktails are chain-restaurant worthy  wine list is weak  and seafood is only barely competently prepared.   Calamari was good. Worth it  served with a large pool (at least 2 cups) of seasoned mayo.   Lobster roll was rubbery and tasteless. The bun was exceptional however. The salmon was Kirkland's best  and  crusted with pecans =sprinkled.  Hmm. The grouper sandwiches were passable. McCain fries. Yum.   The day was sunny. The company was excellent. I noted the The Pump ouse Grill on Lakeshore. I'll park there next time and enjoy the wings.
68O4uYCd0YToLOLqHTBSZQ,35TAAd42m4SdOcX9xkgE6A,5,0,0,0,My sister-in-law and I saw Jeff at the start of the year... we saw his ad and we decided it was something we would want to check out... and we are so glad we did!    Jeff is hilarious and has great stage presence and really connects with his audience.  I even got pulled up on stage and got a crotch full of Jeff!  hahaha...   It's a very high energy show that he never lets up... he just goes and performs his little heart out much to the enjoyment of the audience.    If you're looking for a family friendly show that is different from the usual entertainment on the Strip then you cannot go wrong with Jeff Civillico!
4v7dr2o5qXsHVGh9tM1KLA,34SxcBYRLnM7JAo8zWQexw,4,0,0,0,This is just a great little find with great N'Orleans-style food. Had the blackened trout. Mr. Bill had crayfish. Shared an appetizer of fried green tomatoes. I normally don't care for collard greens  but they were delicious. You have to try the bread pudding  if you have room. Pleasant staff. Good food. What more can you ask for! Oh  yeah  great variety of libations. Thank you for a new Tega Cay eatery that's good!!
1qwkbN3wu3AGDxMTXVz2gA,3Gh-BxQK-jZnWG6alGoiUA,2,0,2,0,This was my first visit to Top Golf  and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone  we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars  you ask?  There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off  when you walk in  its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for  or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out  the first line is the  membership line  - everyone needs a $5 membership.    The second line  is to  check in  - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.    Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time  we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once  and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all  we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.    After all that  we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer  bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.    Then  we get our text message - our bay is ready  requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in)  but thats the way they like it here I guess.    We head to our bay with a  bay concierge  that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world  but it works.    We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu  page by page  explaining burgers  and appetizers  and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a  slider  was.  (Mind you  you pay by the hour at this place  so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac  and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive  chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from  and his Grandma in Colorado  and what it was like working after Christmas  and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh  leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer  not a new pal.  When the chips came out  one in my party leaned over to the server and said   do you know one thing thats missing in this place?   The server leaned in all interested....  napkins - there are no napkins on the table .  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag  and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him   could we have napkins?  - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.  So  we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips  and he comes back with the beer  and no chips (and again  all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time  and we were expected home for dinner  but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.  The kicker though  was that near the end of our session  our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas  there was a five hour wait  and they ran out of food  and booze  and kegs  etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks  and he would buy us desert if we said yes.    OK  this is the business guy in me coming out now  but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process  or that you ran out of beer one night  or that there are no napkins on the table  or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead  they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place  I would be PISSED off.     Again  its a really fun concept  but it will try on your nerves big time.
1cjEfvQBPXZ5YUaAMYJrQ,SUWYCfXR2z3iSdzuxfDTPg,5,0,0,0,Oh my gosh I fell in love with this place today! Lots of vegan options  delicious food - my fav was the falafel and baba ghanoush - and friendly service. Prices are reasonable too. Can't wait to go back for the open face eggplant soon!
eSlmVbicgkhtD9niSuReJw,cE3E1PH1OxvGVMKOloAcEw,5,0,0,0,Snobbish receptionist  good waiters  food is identical to any other Cheese cake factory. And finally they invented a slice of cake that's 1750 calories.  That's art !!!  But their 500 calorie   diet  cheesecake is pretty good. Empty at lunchtime !
Wxxvi3LZbHNIDwJZimtnA,QXar7KXv0PZYjUoTrKDsmg,5,0,0,1,I've stayed at ALL hotels on the strip. Even when Stardust and Frontier was around. I've encountered the atmosphere  the check-in lines  the restaurants  the pools  and the nightclubs of these hotels. HandS DOWN  Venetian & Palazzo has the best to offer in luxury. Yes  there are clubs better than TAO  and better restaurants than the Grand Lux  but those hotels with don't have great service or great decor or rooms as the Venetian. It's like some hotels focus on one great trait (day club  night club  room accommodations)  but the Venetian has it all across the board. Tables are loose  Rooms are suite  family side of pool and adult side. Cosmo is catching up though...but yeah The Venetian is definitely tight butthole
I779CNMLWhZu6BxkGfLvwQ,nDONd9xRtolXGuvclVGK8A,2,0,0,0,FIrst let me explain the 2 stars - we decided to try out the sushi after friends said it was good. We got to Smokin Fins at 6:30 pm thinking we had plenty of time before the Happy Hour menu was over at 7:00 pm. But the wait list was 40 minutes long and we did not get seated until 7:10 pm. Since Happy Hour was over we did not get Happy Hour pricing even though we were waiting on the list for 40 minutes. Left a bad feeling about the service and management. I heard a few other couples expressing their opinions about the same thing but management just said  Sorry   Now for the good part. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and was relaxing inside and outside. The food presentation was impressive.  Service was just OK. The sushi was cut very think and cooked just perfect. If our dinners were not so good we would not return. Since the food was so good  we will give Smokin Fins another chance on our next sushi craving.
0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw,3YvbK97c9wQ6aO2v-AdBHQ,5,1,3,7,I wanted to David Carradine with the lobster spaghetti.
rTZVcJZ8G80i6NjLw0SW8Q,spPM7uVdjJ-zVx2lGMRQRA,3,2,3,2,We came here on Super Bowl Sunday because we were visiting a friend who lived not far from this place.  When deciding on a place to watch the game  a couple of friends suggested this casino because they had a big sports booking place  and also because it wouldn't be as packed and crazy as the casinos on the strip.  This casino is about a 15-20 minute drive from the strip.  We were immediately greeted with the large screens in preparation for the Super Bowl.  They even had the volume turned up so that people in the area could listen.  They also had some TV's over the blackjack tables which was where we spent the second half watching the game.   There's also an aquarium and aquarium-themed restaurant in which they have a [fake] mermaid swimming in the aquarium and then people can take pictures with her afterwards.  There were TV's in the restaurant showing the Super Bowl as well.  And If you sign up for a players card  you get a free buffet (which we didn't take advantage of  though).   OK place overall.  But the sports book area was definitely a cool place to watch the game.  Watch the game while playing penny slots and get free drinks!
H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25AyA,0hzqkA-ODxcgwBwljIFLvA,2,1,2,1,This place looks hopeful on the outside but is actually pretty bad. My maple glazed salmon was very burnt and lacked flavor. The asparagus it came with was pretty disgusting and soggy. The waitress was great and the side Caesar salad I had was good. The experience was horrible simply due to the blasting crappy music as well. Probably don't eat here.
1cjEfvQBPXZ5YUaAMYJrQ,S5GJKEGXAKtFrYaQC8Fuqw,4,2,2,1,This little gem opened up a few month ago and it is run by the same people that have owned the Amena Cafe on Sahara near O'Bannon St. We started with the hummus  tapas  (their tapas are not the Spanish variety of small servings of various culinary concoctions but dippings for pita bread which can be ordered as whole wheat or regular). The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the  Halal  beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.  The decor needs work to give this place a more intimate atmosphere as it was a pizza joint for many years but don't let that stop you from going in. The chairs are not the standard plastic or wood bottoms and it wouldn't take much to get this place a little more elegant. In the meantime go and see Amer and get a taste sensation fix...tell him Nick sent you!
BQqwIYQuo2W94smjrBjy5g,v3twyCe8qeFohwHX7z8eiA,5,1,0,0,OMG SO good!! I can't wait to go back!! Love the atmosphere and the food was amazing (I had the eggplant)....This was one of my favorite culinary experience of my life! We didn't leave anything in our plate!!! Thank you guys!!!
mlCDsdVFuZvRGrJTfQ6amw,gliai8WUPTsJzA7FdjAvTA,4,0,0,0,Adult grilled cheese?  Novel concept.  The food was good (not great).  The wait was long - prepare for a long wait  this place is always packed!  The bread is quite greasy  but the innards were excellent  along with gigantic portions.
WnUttoJffplgWaQGR2J2Xw,WRTdS4wEydKqg0yYGR4gyQ,3,1,0,0,I really don't know how to rate this place. I came for brunch on a Sunday at 12:30 with a reservation. Side note: AWESOME that this place takes brunch reservations. More places should start doing that. But back to my review...so I came at 12:30 with my boyfriend and we promptly ordered a caesar  a bellini  an order of donuts  the duck scramble  and the two egg breakfast. Yes  we're fatsos at heart.   The drinks came in a timely manner  as did the donuts. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. and WAITED. We are by no means slow eaters and we didn't stick around for very long after finishing our food  but we didn't leave this restaurant until close to 3pm! It was quite absurd how long our main dishes took to arrive. Definitely unimpressed with the service.   As for the food itself  I'd call it 'decent'. The donuts were delicious  but the chocolate mousse-like dip it came with was rather tasteless. Actually  I actively didn't like the chocolate dip and I LOVE chocolate. My duck scramble was good but nothing special. I loved the potatoes  but everything else just...normal.   Honestly  the best part about this place  in my opinion  is that it takes brunch reservations. I like the decor inside and it's apparently a very popular drink spot  but I probably won't be back for brunch unless all I want is an order of potatoes and a bellini.
Dd9l9bDHbACessxlKs4UA,wd82vevU88yNVOs5PxEQEA,5,0,0,0,I love it! Almost all options are available in a vegan version. Yum! I am moving  and am so sad I will not longer be able to come here. So I made one last trip today. I hope they consider expanding so I can enjoy the yummy items here once again.
uKKNw68mZZaa1jcyszEbyA,1SDaTE1ERu_Wew1bf0PvJg,3,0,0,0,There's a lot to like about Crepe Bar.  It feels  cool  inside  with an independent vibe that's a valuable commodity in suburban Phoenix.  It's bustling and noisy inside  which I enjoy but may be a negative to some.  The crepes are reasonably priced  and they come with a salad and an unexpected appetizer portion of granola.  The crepes were good but not excellent  and the portions were a little smaller than expected.  Unfortunately  during peak times  you can expect a difficult time finding a seat  and a long wait for your food.  Also  the options for non-pork eaters such as myself were limited.  This place is ideal for killing time sipping coffee on a weekend  but not for much else.
MVSmAYSl4RkgXBg5e8JaQ,88bxLDh5rvds85nnPdKyLw,3,0,5,0,Being a big Laguna Hills OHOP fan  I was disappointed when I visited the Scottsdale AZ location. It felt like a completely different restaurant.  First off--cash only. Wasn't ready for that. Luckily  they have an ATM onsite.  Secondly  they really nerfed the size of the Dutch Baby here. I worked up my friends at how awesome and overwhelmingly large the Dutch Baby is (and that you could share it with two people)  but it was a disappointment. It was bit dry  almost burnt and stale tasting.  Third  I felt very rushed. I know that there is a long line  but they were really pushy about cleaning up our plates immediately after we finished and it made for an uncomfortable eating experience.  All in all  there is little to distinguish this place from an IHOP.
